                    <h2>Will the Real John Wesley Please Stand Up?</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                   
                    <p>As Christians, it is important for us to understand the history of our faith, including the lives and teachings of the great men and women who have come before us. One such figure is John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, whose ordination as a priest in the Church of England on May 2, 1729, marked a significant turning point in his life and ministry. I for one have been deeply impacted by the life and ministry of John Wesley, and part of the reason why I feel it is important to take the time to honor this godly man is due to the way his legacy has been tarnished and corrupted by modern Wesleyans. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The John Wesley I was initially taught was co-opted to fit a modern church agenda. It was nothing like the faithful, holy, pietistic Wesley of the 18th century. You can imagine the shock and awe I felt when I discovered who the real John Wesley was. I ask the question today, will the real John Wesley please stand up?
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Wesley was born into a devout Anglican family in 1703, and he grew up with a strong sense of Christian piety and duty. As a young man, he studied at Oxford University and was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1725. At Oxford, John and his brother Charles developed a deep and lifelong friendship with George Whitefield, the greatest evangelist the English-speaking world has ever known. However, it was not until his ordination as a priest four years later that Wesley began to experience a deep spiritual awakening that would shape the rest of his life and ministry.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Wesley's spiritual awakening was sparked by a conversation with a Moravian missionary, while John was already in ministry, who challenged him to trust in Christ alone for salvation and to experience the "assurance" of salvation through the witness of the Holy Spirit. Yes, it was as a Christian missionary that John Wesley was converted and came to truly understand the gospel. This is what set him on such a powerful trajectory from that day forward. This experience transformed Wesley's understanding of Christianity and set him on a path of evangelism, personal piety, and positive social action that would eventually lead to the founding of the Methodist movement.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        One of Wesley's key insights was the importance of personal piety in the Christian life. He believed that true faith should not just be a matter of intellectual assent, but should be lived out in daily practice. This led him to emphasize the importance of regular prayer, Bible study, and participation in the sacraments as means of deepening one's relationship with God. Many Christians today would look at the life of John Wesley and accuse him of legalism or Phariseeism. Despite these outlandish accusations, Wesley was simply living out in public the personal desires of his heart. This is not legalism but true spiritual transformation. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        At the same time, Wesley also recognized the importance of social action as an expression of Christian faith. He believed that Christians had a duty to care for the poor, the sick, and the marginalized, and he encouraged his followers to engage in acts of charity and social reform. This emphasis on both personal piety and social action would become a hallmark of the Methodist movement. Unfortunately, this has been hijacked today by the social action wing of the movement, who has forgotten the importance of gospel-centered piety as the prerequisite and foundation for social action. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Despite Wesley's deep commitment to the Church of England, he eventually found himself at odds with many of its leaders and teachings. In particular, he was troubled by the church's emphasis on "works righteousness," which he believed led people to rely on their own good deeds rather than on the grace of God. He also disagreed with the church's strict adherence to liturgical forms and practices, which he believed stifled spiritual growth and innovation.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        These disagreements eventually led Wesley (and Whitefield) to break away from the Church of England and form the Methodist movement, which would become one of the largest and most influential Christian denominations in the world. The Methodism you think of today is not the Methodism of Wesley’s day. In Wesley’s day it was a gospel-centered, Bible-preaching, life-altering work of the Lord. Today, it is marked by lesbain bishops and transgender pastors.

                        As we reflect on the life and ministry of John Wesley 294 years after his ordination, we are reminded of the power of a deep and personal faith in Christ, and of the importance of using that faith to make a positive difference in the world around us. Christians can all learn from Wesley's example of a life lived in faithful service to God and to others. May we be inspired to follow in his footsteps, as we seek to grow in faith and to make a positive impact on the world around us.</p>
