                    <h2>Just War Theory: Its Biblical Roots and Contemporary Relevance</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                               
                    <p>I recently finished a book discussing the American war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq, and since the book doesn’t have any immediate relevance or application for Christians, I figured the best thing to do would be to discuss when, if ever, it is okay for a nation to go to war, and how we as Christians should think about this moral issue. The book wasn’t anything to write home about either, so I’m not going to bother giving it a shout out on this blog either. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Warfare is a topic full of complex ethical and moral dilemmas. The Just War Theory is one of the main ideologies (and in my opinion the biblical solution) that seeks to balance the bleak reality of war with ethical considerations. The theory's fundamental goal is to establish a moral framework for warfare by defining the circumstances in which a war can be morally justifiably started (Jus ad bellum) and how it can be morally fought (Jus in bello).
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Let's start by looking at Just War Theory’s guiding ideas. They are predicated on the idea that, despite being dreadful, war is not always the most catastrophic thing that may occur. There are instances where using force is necessary to achieve peace and justice. Jus ad bellum, or the justice of war, and jus in bello, or justice in war, are the two categories used by the Just War Theory to distinguish between rightful and unjust actions of war.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Jus ad bellum comprises six primary principles: just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, probability of success, proportionality, and last resort.  Defending against an aggressive act is commonly referred to as having a "just cause." The choice to declare war must be made by a legitimate authority, according to legitimate authority. According to the definition of "right intention," establishing a just peace must be the ultimate objective. War must not result in the pointless sacrifice of lives and resources, according to the "probability of success" principle. According to the 'proportionality' principle, the amount of violence used to inflict harm must be in accordance with the harm caused. Last but not least, the principle of "last resort" states that war should only be pursued after all nonviolent options have been explored and exhausted.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Two other tenets of jus in bello are discrimination and proportionality. Attacks should only be directed at legitimate military objectives, according to the discrimination theory, and civilians should be spared as little as possible. According to the principle of proportionality, in order to prevent unwarranted harm, the amount of force used should correspond to the military gain desired.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Just War Theory has a number of historical proponents, but it traces its origin directly back to Scripture itself. The concepts of just war are consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Apostles as well as the ideas of justice and righteousness found in the Old Testament, although not being specifically stated in the Bible (kinda like the Trinity).
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Although battle is portrayed in the Old Testament as a fact of life, there are nonetheless unstated guidelines for how it should be conducted. Deuteronomy 20:10–18, for instance, lays out guidelines for how Israelites should wage battle and outlines basic principles of discrimination and proportionality. It mentions making peace before besieging a city, sparing non-combatants, and refraining from cutting down fruit trees—a command that can be viewed as an early expression of the idea of non-combatant immunity and environmental preservation.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The New Testament encourages peace, forgiveness, and love for one's enemies, especially in the teachings of Jesus and Paul. However, it does not fully ban the use of force when necessary. Apostle Paul affirms the authority's responsibility for defending justice in Romans 13:3–4, which includes using the sword to confront the wrongdoer. Scholars have taken this to mean that it supports just war in certain situations.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        These biblical precepts were expanded upon by early Christian thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and Augustine of Hippo, who laid the groundwork for the Just War Theory. War, according to Augustine, may be a necessary evil in order to avert more serious injury or injustice. The fundamental concepts of just cause, legitimate authority, and right intention—which are at the heart of contemporary just war theory—were further developed by Aquinas.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Today's governments and international organizations use the Just War Theory as a moral compass to help them make judgments about going to war and choosing peace. International humanitarian laws and treaties, such as the Geneva Conventions, that specify how wars should be handled in an effort to limit injury, especially to civilians, have been influenced by the concepts of the just war theory.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        It's important to remember that even if the Just War Theory offers a useful framework for considering the morality of war, it doesn't lessen the enormous responsibility that goes along with choosing to wage war. It demands constant moral watchfulness before, during, and after the battle. Not only is it about choosing to go to war, but also about how we fight it and work to restore justice and peace afterward.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        In the most difficult situations, where choices affect people's lives and the course of history, the Just War Theory aims to offer moral principles. It is firmly anchored in biblical teachings and concepts, reflecting humanity's ongoing struggle to balance moral obligations with the challenging circumstances of life. The ideology emphasizes the need to safeguard justice, defend the innocent, and maintain our common humanity even in times of war. Oh yeah, and don’t bother reading that book. Happy Friday and enjoy the weekend. My apologies for a sparse week of blogging, my fingers needed to give the keyboard a rest this week.</p>
