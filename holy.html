            <h2>Theology Thursday #2- The Holiness of God</h2>
            <br>
 
 <p>In this week’s installment of Theology Thursday, we’re going to begin a deep dive into the attributes of God for the indefinite future. This means that we’re going to start this week with the holiness of God. </p>
 <p>Thomas Watson, one of my favorite Puritan authors, says that the holiness of God is the sparkling jewel in his crown of glory. The good doctor Martin Lloyd-Jones has been known to say “all preaching must begin with the holiness of God.” That sounds true and it’s something I want to agree with, but there’s a problem we encounter.</p>
 <p>We have no idea how holy God is. This is not only true of the American church today with how we worship God and talk about God, but it was also true in the Bible. In Leviticus 10, two of Aaron’s sons offered ‘strange fire’ to God, unauthorized worship, and the Lord killed them instantly for profaning right worship. In Numbers 25, Phinehas, another son of Aaron the priest, killed two people in his efforts to be zealous for the holiness of God. The people of Israel were in open, unrepentant sexual sin, and so in an effort to turn away the wrath of Holy God, he speared two people in the act of sin and turned God’s wrath away. One more example of how holy God is from the Old Testament, yet humanity fails to grasp just how holy God is… in 2 Samuel 6 we have the story of Uzzah and the ark of the covenant. They were transporting the ark of the covenant when it began to rock and looked like it was going to fall to the ground. Uzzah, one of the men helping to transport it, reached out his hand to touch the ark itself. Now, the ark had been carried on poles, since the Law made it clear that no one was able to touch the ark itself. Uzzah reaches out to steady the ark, touching it, and falls dead instantly. Uzzah mistakenly thought it would have been worse for the ark to fall to the ground than for his unclean, sinful hands to profane God’s dwelling place. Let me say this again: we have no idea how holy God is.</p>
 <p>The word holy simply means marked off or set apart, withdrawn from common or ordinary use. Wayne Grudem, in his big blue book, says that God’s holiness means He is separated from sin and devoted to seeking his own honor. The root of the Hebrew word for holy (quadosh) has the idea of something being cut out and set apart from. It means that God is sacred, awesome, singled out. Most scholars and theologians divide the holiness of God into two categories: God’s majestic holiness and God’s moral holiness. </p>
 <p>The way I want to examine God’s holiness today and discuss it is through looking at a familiar passage, Isaiah 6:1-7. </p>
 
<h4>Holiness in Isaiah: God’s Majestic Holiness (v. 1-4)</h4>


<p>Let’s define it first, then see how the passage in Isaiah colors in the lines of what we mean. God’s majestic holiness means God is infinitely great, He is transcendently distinct from all his creation in exponential glory. There is an enormous chasm that separates God from us. He exceeds all comparison. There is no concept for us of how above us God is. This sense of holiness qualifies all his other attributes, holy love, holy wrath, holy power, etc. (Big John Macarthur). </p>
<p>Verse 1: In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. </p>
<p>Right away, we see God’s majestic holiness put on display. Isaiah says that he “saw” the Lord, but the word used does not mean that Isaiah first saw God… it means that God chose to reveal himself to Isaiah. This is the only way a holy God can be seen by a sinful human- if He chooses to reveal himself and come near. </p>
<p>Isaiah sees God sitting on a throne, high and exalted, lofty, raised up. The idea here is that God is inhabiting the throne, he has always been seated upon it, and he will always be seated upon it. His holiness has always reigned over all the earth. In the biblical storyline, the throne is the location of the holiness of God. In other words, Isaiah is in THE PLACE, THE PRESENCE where God’s holiness is most intensely felt. </p>
<p>To further add to the idea of holiness and God’s perfect display of it, the train of his robe fills the temple. These are priestly robes that Isaiah sees here- a priest would put these on when he was consecrated for his priestly duties. And so, God’s priestly robes literally fulfill or complete the space of the temple. They are a demonstration of the fact that God’s holiness is the ultimate picture for what the priests, the sacrificial system, and the temple are meant to display. They point the people of Israel to the holy God that they worship. </p>
<p>Isaiah first sees this holy God sitting on his throne, and  he then sees, verse 2, Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</p>
<p>Now, many of us are probably wondering: what are seraphim? Well, the name, Seraphs, literally means ‘burning ones.’ In the OT, fire is the chief symbol of the holiness of God, and so Isaiah gives the appropriate name to the picture he sees: massive flames of fires surrounding the throne of the Holy One. But there’s more to the story than that. This is the only place in the whole Bible seraphim are mentioned, but Jewish tradition tells us they are similar to the serpents mentioned in Numbers 21 (bronze serpent). So, it is safe to assume that seraphim are fiery serpents with six wings, which, as you can imagine, would be a terrifying sight. They were spiritual beings whose role was to praise and worship God. And the seraphim are ‘above’ God’s throne, the position of a servant waiting upon a master. </p>
<p>Even these angelic beings, as powerful and awe-inspiring as they must have been, humbled themselves before a holy God. They cover their faces so as not to look directly at God, and they cover their feet as well, both of which are symbols of humility and adoration. The scene you’re imagining right now puts on display the majestic holiness of God- his exceeding transcendence, his other-ness, his being set apart, which everything so far in this passage is pointing us to. </p>
<p>Verse 3: And one (of the seraphim) called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!” And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. </p>
<p>This is a terrifying scene starting to unfold here. The seraphim aren’t just whispering or saying this in an inside voice to each other… it’s a shout, a proclamation, a cry to each other and anyone else around the throne room that God is holy, holy, holy. Holy is the only superlative of God raised to the third degree, called the trisagion (there’s your fancy theological word for the day). The idea here is way more than just sinless purity, which we’ll get to- here God’s holiness is the essence of his otherness. His transcendence. How far beyond our comprehension he really is. God is absolutely and totally distinct from all his creation, and exalted above them in infinite glory and majesty. </p>
<p>And to quote another man way smarter than me, “Here is what the seraphim are ultimately saying: God is holy, which means God is God. Earlier, when we defined the word holy, we said it means to cut from and to set apart- and this is true of creation. People are set apart and devoted to God, things are consecrated and set apart and devoted to God in the temple, etc. Anything can become holy if it is set apart and devoted to God. But, how can you separate God and make him holy? The very god-ness of God means that he is separate. That God is one of a kind and in a class completely by himself. God is utterly holy. God’s holiness is derived from his own character, his own nature. God is absolute. His majestic holiness is his unique, transcendent, pure essence, which is who He is as God. Holiness is who he is and what no one else will ever be. Language runs out and all we can keep saying is ‘holy’ to describe this attribute of God (John Piper).” </p>
<p>Like we said earlier, God’s holiness is the attribute that modifies all of his other attributes. Here, the glory of God is the outshining, the outward display, of the holiness of God. His glory is his revealed holiness. The glory of God’s majesty should strike terror and awe in those who it is revealed to. ‘The whole earth is full of his glory’ tells us that God is ruling and has always ruled. It is God’s glory and his glory alone. The whole earth is full of God’s glory, his omnipresent holiness.</p>

<h4>Holiness in Isaiah: God’s Moral Holiness (v. 5-7)</h4>


<p>We move now into the second aspect of God’s holiness: His moral holiness, which is what most of us probably think about when we think of the holiness of God. God's moral holiness means that God is morally perfect, flawless, sinless, free from all blemishes, and intrinsically pure and infinitely good. It means that God must reject all that is unholy and all that doesn’t perfectly conform to his holiness. It shows us that God hates sin, that every sin must be punished to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>Verse 5:  And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”</p>
<p>If Isaiah’s lips are unclean, then so is his heart. ‘Unclean’ is a general term used in the Old Testament for anything that is unfit to be in God’s presence. God’s holiness has revealed to his prophet his own unworthiness. God’s holiness here is so overpowering that it condemns the sinner, Isaiah, to death, which we see by the word he uses ‘lost’, which we will look at in just a moment. </p>
<p>Seeing God produces in Isaiah not worship initially, but sheer terror (fear of the Lord). Isaiah recognized in this moment two things: he is unclean, and he has seen God. Isaiah cannot praise and serve God as the seraphs do because, in the depths of his being, he is unclean, just as his compatriots are. It is remarkable to see the prophet identify himself so completely with those whose sins he has been denouncing in the previous chapters. But in the presence of God, degrees of sin become irrelevant. It is the holiness of God which reveals to us our true condition, not comparison with others.</p>
<p>The reason Isaiah is filled with terror at the sight of God and his own sinfulness is because he knows that a Holy God must punish all sin. Sin cannot stand in his presence. It would be like standing barefoot on the surface of the sun. You would get incinerated.</p>
<p>And this perfectly leads us to the final aspect of God’s holiness Isaiah talks about, the need for atonement, for a payment to be made for the sins of the people.</p>
<p>Verse 6-7:  Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”</p>
<p>Propitiation means “averting the wrath of God by the offering of a gift.” It refers to the turning away of the wrath of God as the just judgment of our sin by God’s own provision of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. I like to define it as “a payment that satisfies.”</p>
<p>The hot coal taken from the altar of heaven demonstrates God’s purifying work. The altar from which the burning coal is taken by the seraphs is not named. It may have been the incense altar before the veil or the bronze altar which stood in the inner court. But it does not matter. The altar, whatever its identity, symbolizes the entire provision which God had made in the temple and its services for the sins of his people. Isaiah is cleansed, not by his own efforts, but purely by the grace of God. </p>
<p>This sacrifice on the altar is in accordance with the Levitical ordinances (Leviticus 1:4 He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him). This is the most applicable aspect of God’s holiness: The Lord has taken the initiative throughout: revealing (2–3), excluding (4–5), and now atoning (v. 6-7). Now one of the seraphs, who flew only by divine command, is sent as the messenger of salvation. In the Old Testament, however, fire is not a cleansing agent but the expression of the active, even hostile, holiness of God (Gen. 3:24; Num. 11:1–3; Deut. 4:12, 33, 36). This, however, was fire from the altar, the place where holiness accepted, and was satisfied by, the death of a substitutionary sacrifice (Lev. 17:11). Something died, blood was spilled, to atone for the sins of Isaiah. </p>
<p>Atonement refers to God’s act of dealing with humanity’s problem of sin. The basis of atonement is a ‘covering price’. The live coal encapsulates the ideas of atonement, propitiation, satisfaction, forgiveness, cleansing and reconciliation, and of these spiritual realities Isaiah, the doomed sinner, is left in no doubt when the seraph explains: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.” Isaiah’s sin debt has been covered. He has been made clean, washed new. </p>
<p>God’s holiness displays the absolute necessity of the atonement. The holiness of God demands the cross. God’s holiness, which initially seems so forbidding and judgmental, is the means of our salvation. It is because God is holy, and we are sinful, that God makes a way for us, by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus at the cross. I’ve said it before: the price of our salvation, the price of the grace of God, is the perfect, sinless, spotless life of Jesus, demonstrated through his blood poured out on our behalf. There is one thing and one thing only able to pay for sin: the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The more we champion the holiness of God, the more we see how amazing grace is, how worthy this Holy God is to be worshiped. And the more we see how worthy he is to be worshiped, the more we desire to pursue holiness and sanctification in our own lives. This is a communicable attribute of God’s, meaning we should be embodying this in our daily lives.</p>
