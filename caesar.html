                    <h2>Will Caesar Raise Your Kids?</h2>
                    <br>
                    Will Caesar Raise Your Kids?

                    <p>Who do your kids belong to? Are they yours, or does someone else lay claim to their values, their
                        education, and their upbringing? Any number of secular organizations would love to get their
                        hands on your children and indoctrinate their values upon them. BLM would love to show your
                        children how critical theory is alive and well in America, and how they should be ashamed of
                        their white privilege their parents gave them. Drag queens would love to pedofile themselves to
                        our kids as they read them sexualized stories of queer fantasies in a public library, convincing
                        them their perverted lifestyle is normal and ought to be accepted. I ask again– who do your kids
                        belong to? And who will raise them? Will it be the church, or will it be the state? Will the
                        secular world, referred to hereafter as Caesar, raise your kids?</p>

                    <p>As parents, we are entrusted with the immense responsibility of nurturing and raising our
                        children in the way they should go, as the Scripture says, "Train up a child in the way he
                        should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6). It is our duty to
                        not only raise our children but to do so in a manner that allows them to grow in the faith and
                        wisdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, not in the faith and wisdom of Caesar.</p>

                    <p>In our modern secular age, we must be vigilant in not allowing Caesar to raise our children. When
                        we allow the secular world to shape our children's values, beliefs, and actions, we risk losing
                        the very foundation of Christian upbringing and identity, the stability of a future Christian
                        society, and even worse, the eternal salvation of our children.</p>

                    <h4>The Loss of Biblical Values and Principles</h4>

                    <p>The first risk we encounter in allowing the secular age to raise our children is the loss of
                        biblical values and principles. We live in a society that often promotes moral relativism, where
                        truth is seen as subjective and dependent on individual perspectives. This stands in stark
                        contrast to the absolute truths found in the Word of God.</p>

                    <p>When we let Caesar raise our children, they will be exposed to ideas that go against the
                        teachings of Christ. They will be told marriage is not between one man and one woman. They will
                        be told that gender is relative and that boys can be girls. They will be encouraged to explore
                        their sexual desires and do whatever makes them happy. This, of course, is madness. And
                        Christian parents cannot let this happen. By taking ownership of our children's spiritual
                        upbringing, we can ensure that they are grounded in biblical values and principles that will
                        guide them throughout their lives.</p>

                    <h4>The Erosion of Christian Identity</h4>

                    <p>Another issue we face when we let the secular age raise our children is the erosion of their
                        Christian identity. As followers of Christ, we are called to be set apart from the world. But
                        when we allow secular influences to dominate our children's lives, they can begin to blend into
                        the worldly culture, losing the distinctiveness of their faith.</p>

                    <p>To counter this, we must be intentional about fostering a strong Christian identity in our
                        children. We can do this by incorporating daily prayer, Bible study, and discussions about faith
                        into our family routines. This isn’t legalistic. This is spiritual discipline. And it is
                        shocking how Christians who prioritize these values in their families have children that look a
                        lot more like Christ and a lot less like the world. By actively nurturing their Christian
                        identity, we give our children the tools they need to stand firm in their faith amidst a secular
                        world.</p>

                    <h4>The Undermining of the Christian Worldview</h4>

                    <p>Lastly, when we let Caesar raise our children, we risk undermining the Christian worldview that
                        serves as the foundation of their beliefs. The secular world is constantly promoting ideas that
                        conflict with a biblical perspective, from the source of creation to the sanctity of life.</p>

                    <p>As Christian parents, it is our responsibility to teach our children a biblical worldview that
                        will enable them to discern truth from error. We can do this by engaging in conversations about
                        current events, popular culture, and the challenges they face in their daily lives, always
                        bringing the discussion back to Scripture and the teachings of Christ. Most importantly, we do
                        this by teaching them the Bible. It is impossible to discern truth from error without knowing
                        what truth is, and so a right and thorough understanding of the Bible is needed for this.
                        Parents, we must teach our children the Bible.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                    <p>It is not enough to simply avoid the negative influences of the secular age. We must also
                        actively invest in our children's spiritual growth, teaching them the importance of a personal
                        relationship with Jesus Christ. As we guide our children through this challenging world, we must
                        be vigilant in our efforts to protect them from Caesar's grasp, ensuring that they grow into
                        strong, faithful followers of Christ. In doing so, we can raise a generation of Christians
                        equipped to stand firm in their faith and make a lasting impact on the world for the glory of
                        God. Parents, I beg you, do not let Caesar raise your kids.</p>
