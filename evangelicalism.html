                    <h2>The Death of Evangelicalism</h2>
                    <br>



<p>The word evangelical used to mean something. It used to have value, and association with the term meant camaraderie around gospel-centered beliefs. The term evangelical itself derives from the Greek word for “gospel”. So from the beginning, evangelicals have always had their compass pointed at the gospel. The term has been used to describe mighty men of God such as R.C. Sproul, Billy Graham, John Piper, J.I. Packer, and John Macarthur. Indeed, these men were wholeheartedly evangelical their entire lives and embraced the term as a means of fellowship with other believers who also affirmed the same doctrines and beliefs. I would argue, however, that today, the word evangelical means nothing. We need a new word to serve in its place. </p>

<p>Think of the word evangelical like a bundle of hay in the middle of a pasture. All the cows see the hay, they like the hay, so they all congregate towards it. The cows could be from a different place, different upbringing, different beliefs about the water, the sun, the type of hay, how they should get the hay, etc., but all the cows agree they need the hay and they’re going to unite around it. But then all of a sudden one of the cows sees something in the distance– something shiny. They leave the hay and go over to look at it. They wander, and they bring other cows with them. Some of the cows leave the hay and go off in search of this other object. They might get hit by a car, attacked by a wolf, the end result is still the same– they have left the group. These cows would claim to still be part of the same group, but their focus has changed. They are in fact not actually a part of the same group.</p>

<p>The solution in this instance is to put up a fence around the cows. This keeps them focused on the hay but prevents them from wandering off in pursuit of other shiny golden calves they think will bring them the joy and satisfaction they need. A fence would have prevented the church from moving in the direction of the cultural BLM movements during the COVID-19 pandemic. A fence would have stopped every megachurch in the country from embracing altar calls and all call baptisms. A fence would have prevented the church from continuing to compromise with culture every chance they get in order to “preserve their witness.” Just like the cows needed a fence, so too does the church. Let’s look at what caused the church to wander away from the hay, and then talk about putting a fence in place.</p>

<p><strong>Altar Calls and All Call Baptisms</p></strong>

<p>Altar calls can lead to emotionalism and superficial conversions. This practice can result in false conversions, which undermine the spiritual health of the church and obscure the true nature of the Gospel message. All Call Baptisms are another problematic practice, as it can encourage a hurried and superficial approach to the sacred sacrament of baptism. By overlooking the need for genuine repentance and faith in Christ, this practice has led to an undervaluation of the significance of baptism and a false sense of spiritual security among church members. Thus, the majority of evangelical church members are unregenerate. They are dead, spiritually, but they have been falsely told they are alive. This is a dangerous position to be in.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of Doctrinal Fidelity</p></strong>

<p>The evangelical church today has no doctrinal fidelity, no strong convictions about what it believes. Is Calvinism a priority? Or can we just “agree to disagree” on that one? Where do we draw the line on issues that are essential or ones that aren’t so important? The erosion of doctrinal fidelity within the church is a major concern, as it makes the church susceptible to secular worldly philosophies and unbiblical teachings. Maintaining a strong commitment to biblical doctrine is essential for preserving the church's spiritual integrity and preventing the spread of false teachings that may lead believers astray.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Compromise</p></strong>

<p>The evangelical church is a church that looks just like the world. When churches want to support the rights women (biological, of course) have to abortions and continue to advocate for “love” in the midst of the homosexual and transgender revolution, the church is no longer distinct from the world, the church is the world. When this happens, there is no longer a reason to come to church. Why do you think Unitarian churches are closing their doors all across the country? There’s nothing distinct about them. Evangelical churches are headed in the same direction. This cultural compromise dilutes the Gospel's transformative power, leads to spiritual apathy, and risks undermining the distinctiveness of Christian beliefs and practices.</p>

<p><strong>Secularistic Philosophies</p></strong>

<p>Recent years have seen the rise of Marxist and postmodern ideologies in the church. You could attend an evangelical church in America and have the pastor speak from the pulpit about reparations and white privilege, trying to use Scripture to justify pagan teachings. The infiltration of secular ideologies into the church has eroded its doctrinal integrity and weakened believers' commitment to biblical truth. There must be vigilance against the adoption of such philosophies, which have led to moral relativism, syncretism, and a denial of core Christian doctrines.</p>

<p><strong>Unwillingness to Suffer for the Gospel</p></strong>

<p>The church today that embraces evangelicalism is not a church that is willing to suffer. Yes, they say they will suffer for the gospel, but when the time comes, this does not happen. Churches willingly closed their doors at Caesar’s request during COVID and kept them closed, even persecuting other Christians for daring to open up their churches to worship God. The evangelical church today is not a church that suffers for the gospel. This unwillingness to suffer has resulted in a superficial faith, causing believers to prioritize personal comfort over faithfulness to biblical teachings and the advancement of God's kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>No Precedent</p></strong>

<p>It is shocking that many of these contemporary issues and trends lack historical precedent in the life of the church. The reason the true, orthodox church has never faced these issues on such a large scale is because whenever these problems arose, they dealt with them promptly and effectively. This departure from time-tested practices and traditions has resulted in a weakened understanding of Christian doctrine and a loss of the church's historical foundation, making it vulnerable to the false teachings and influences of the world.</p>

<p><strong>A Much Needed Fence</p></strong>

<p>Call me old fashioned, but my recommendation for a fence is not a new concept, it is in fact a very dated one. My proposition for the evangelical fence is a statement of faith. No, not like the watered-down Baptist Faith and Message 2000. I mean a robust, comprehensive, and exclusive statement of faith. The point is not to get everyone and their mother into the fenced area. If we want the word evangelical to mean something, back up the term with the Westminster Confession of Faith or the 1689 London Baptist Confession. These towering confessions do well to summarize 2,000 years of Christian orthodoxy, and the modern church has been foolish to neglect using them more today. If the term evangelical is to be saved, it must be done by clinging to doctrine and tightening the circle among who is allowed to be part of the group. Frankly, I don’t want to be part of a group that a gay bishop or female pastor could also claim allegiance to. If the Western Church will not do this, then we must put to death the term “evangelical”. To do so will be essential for our witness in the future and our separation from the apostate branches of so-called evangelicalism that remain.</p>
