            <h2>Weekly Wrap Up: Friday, March 17th, 2023</h2>
            <br>
           <p>On Friday’s I plan to write about whatever’s buzzing in culture. No balloons got shot down this week and no more Presidential homes were raided, so I’m going to talk about Patrick– the man for whom today was named. Maybe when you enjoy a fine pilsner later, you ought to reflect on this marvelous man of God. </p>
           <p>The true account of Saint Patrick is far more entertaining than the legends and myths that have arisen around him. I am fond of saying reality is stranger than fiction, and that proverb rings true here. The actual events of his life eclipse the fictitious claims that have evolved through the years. Today, St. Patrick's Day brings to mind leprechauns, shamrocks, pots of gold, and the color green, as seen in various festivities such as the renowned dyeing of the Chicago River. However, before these myths gained traction, there was the historical Patrick, an individual who, as a young boy, endured a difficult upbringing before coming to faith in Christ.
</p>
           <p>Born in 385 A.D. in Roman Britannia, in present-day Dumbarton, Scotland, Patrick penned an autobiographical work entitled St. Patrick's Confession. In this account, he presents himself as a modest, unassuming believer, and briefly touches on his early years. At the age of 16, Patrick was seized by Irish marauders and transported to Ireland, where he was enslaved, and his life took a momentous shift. For six years, Patrick toiled as a shepherd and farm laborer in captivity. In time, the story goes that he was granted a vivid dream or vision, which ultimately offered him a means of escape. He journeyed 200 miles to the coast, where he discovered a British vessel prepared to carry him homeward.

</p>
           <p>Patrick's faith, which had been lukewarm prior to his abduction, was fortified during his period of bondage. It is remarkable how the Lord often uses suffering in the lives of individuals to draw them nearer to Himself. Upon his return home, Patrick wholeheartedly dedicated himself to Christianity. He entered the priesthood and sensed a compelling call to venture back to Ireland, sharing his faith with the very people who had once enslaved him.
</p>
           <p>Embarking on the formidable task of converting pagan Ireland, Patrick encountered resistance from Loegaire, the pagan king of the land. Undeterred by the perils and risks to his own life, Patrick persevered in his divine mission. Eventually, he baptized the king, which catalyzed the conversion of numerous Irish citizens. While it is claimed that Patrick banished snakes from Ireland, this is more likely a metaphor for the transformative influence of Christianity on Irish culture. Indeed, many itinerant evangelists today would be hard-pressed to cast out serpents, and if they could, I would run, not listen to what they had to say!
</p>
           <p>Patrick earned the title "Apostle of Ireland" and established numerous churches, beginning with one in a location called Saul, in Northern Ireland. The difficulty with Patrick's story lies in discerning fact from legend. For example, there is no concrete evidence to support the notion that he utilized the shamrock to teach pagans about the Holy Trinity. Let us optimistically assume he did not, for if he had, he would stand accused of heresy. That would be Modalism, Patrick!</p>
           <p>Interestingly, Patrick is not formally recognized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. This observation is made solely to offer historical accuracy, as I pride myself on not particularly caring who the Catholic church gives sainthood to. Patrick himself knew that he was a sinner, not a saint. Tradition holds that he died on March 17, 461, possibly in Saul, where his first church was founded. A monument celebrating his life stands there, adorned with panels illustrating scenes from his journey.</p>
           <p>
In terms of observing St. Patrick's Day, the holiday should not serve as an excuse for unrestrained vice, but rather as an occasion to share the authentic story of St. Patrick. The "St. Patrick's Breastplate" or "Lorica," a prayer for protection traditionally ascribed to him, reminds us to center our thoughts on Christ, the one he proclaimed to those who had once enslaved him. Consequently, let us focus on Christ rather than luck and the color green—and perhaps endeavor to do so every day, not merely on March 17th.
