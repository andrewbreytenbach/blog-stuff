                    <h2>Images and Icons: Immodest Idols or Informative Illustrations?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Should Christians be allowed to watch shows such as “The Chosen” or a film like “The Passion of the Christ”? Questions such as these are warranted, since “The Chosen” is the most streamed television series of all time, and many argue it is an excellent tool for sharing the gospel and evangelism. Unfortunately, we need to deal with the negative side to this as well– letting Dallas Jenkins shape an entire generation's view of Christ using a mostly non-scriptural basis for his episodes. At the end of the day, is it really beneficial for us to tell all these people about Jesus, when we are giving them a Jesus not found in the Bible? This touches on the much larger issue of images and icons in the everyday life of the church.</p>

                    <p>The second commandment, found in Exodus 20:4-6, forbids the making and worshiping of images representing God. That is to say, any and all images representing God. A sculpture made 1500 years ago and the TV show airing today, all of them are images of God made by fallen human creatures that could be used in worship. The Bible explicitly forbids them. There isn’t a further clause for case studies or potential clarifications. There are no exceptions. I want to examine the biblical reasoning, the potential dangers of images in worship, and the appropriate use of art and imagination for the Christian.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Scope of the Second Commandment</h4>
                    
                    <p>According to a clear and simple reading of the Bible, the second commandment, found in Exodus 20:4-6, explicitly prohibits the use of any image of God in worship. This prohibition is not limited to images that borrow from pagan practices or present a distorted and degraded view of God, but rather encompasses all forms of visual representation. The use of animals to represent God is strictly forbidden, as demonstrated by the incident with Aaron and the golden calf in Exodus 32. In this story, the Israelites quickly fell into idolatry by worshiping the golden calf, which was intended to represent God.</p>
                    
                    <p>Furthermore, the second commandment also precludes the use of the highest created image God gives us: man. This means that even images of Christ are prohibited in worship settings, as they would necessitate an idealized likeness of humanity in their depiction. Creating images of Christ, who is both fully human and fully divine, can inadvertently lead to an incomplete or distorted understanding of His true nature. Jesus wasn’t white with blonde hair and blue eyes, and we don’t need any more pictures of him serving the Last Supper to other European looking disciples. </p>
                    
                    <p>This interpretation of the second commandment serves as a reminder of the importance of focusing on God's true nature and character, as revealed through scripture, rather than relying on potentially misleading visual representations. By avoiding the use of images in worship, believers are encouraged to engage with God on a deeper, more personal level, fostering a genuine relationship that is not limited by the confines of human-made images. The prohibition of images in worship ultimately serves to protect the purity of the worship experience and maintain a proper focus on the inscrutable nature of God as revealed in the Bible.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Biblical Reasoning for the Prohibition</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Images Dishonor God:</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>Utilizing images of God in worship not only adds features to His divine being but also obscures significant aspects of His person and character, resulting in idolatry. For instance, the golden calf conceals other essential truths about God, while crucifixes emphasize Christ's human vulnerability and suffering, overlooking His divine power and authority. Relying on pictures of God to understand and worship Him is inherently flawed, as these images are incapable of accurately reflecting His true glory and majesty, which are vital for authentic worship. It goes without saying no finite human creature will ever be able to accurately display or represent the eternal King of the universe.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Images Mislead Us:</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>The use of images in worship can inadvertently communicate false ideas about God, leading individuals away from the truth. A prime example is the golden calf, which not only misrepresented God but also led the Israelites into immoral and debaucherous behavior, prostituting themselves out to false worship. Focusing on an image of God during prayer or worship can distort one's understanding of His nature, ultimately causing a person to worship an inaccurate representation of God rather than His true divine essence. And nobody wants to be an idolator, right?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Mental Images of God:</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>The second commandment's prohibition extends beyond physical images to include mental images of God as well. Creating a mental image of God based on our idealized values or preconceptions, rather than on the revelation provided by Scripture, risks prioritizing our subjective perceptions over the objective truth of God's nature. This can lead to a distorted understanding of God and hinder a genuine relationship with Him. This one is much more subtle and needs wisdom and discernment to fight against.</p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>God's Revelation in His Word:</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>God has chosen to reveal Himself through His Word, not through images (Deuteronomy 4). In other words, God provided us with the Bible as a means to know Him, rather than a child’s picture book. The second commandment urges us to seek God as He is revealed in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of engaging with the Bible to understand and connect with God's true nature, rather than relying on visible images that may distort our perception of Him.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>The second commandment serves as a reminder of the potential dangers associated with using images, whether physical or mental, in our understanding and worship of God. By directing us to seek God as revealed in Scripture, the commandment encourages a deeper, more accurate relationship with Him, free from the limitations and distortions that images can impose. What does that mean for us? Stop watching “The Chosen”. Recognize the absurdity of the nudity on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In your personal life, don’t propagate or seek out images and icons of God. Maybe, just maybe, consider leaving baby Jesus out of the nativity set this year. After all, he is God.</p>
