            <h2>The Rise and Fall of the Rise and Fall of Mars Hill</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Christian love to gossip. It’s an acceptable sin we propagate, tolerate, and most of the time even appreciate, since it is by the venom of this particular sin we get much of the information we should not have. The most recent example of how gossip showed its fangs and bit the church, resulting in this deadly venom coursing through the bloodstream of evangelicalism, is through a podcast produced by Christianity <strike>Astray</strike> Today. “The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill” not only gave a platform to the advancement of this venom in the wider church, but its fangs latched on to the cultural moment, not letting go, until it ensured the audience was stricken with a mortal wound. In one of the great ironies of sin and lack of foresight, the podcast itself rose and fell too. Thus, the quippy title I gave this post. So before you go and listen to Mike Kosper give you a one-sided story about what happened, let me lay the facts down before you, and leave the one-sided stories to Fox News and CNN.</p>
            <p>Mars Hill Church was a multi-site megachurch founded in Seattle, Washington, in 1996 by Pastor Mark Driscoll and Mike Gunn. Over the next two decades, the church experienced rapid growth and expanded to 15 locations across five states, with a combined weekly attendance of over 12,000 people. Driscoll's passionate and unapologetic preaching style, coupled with the church's focus on community, mission, an living a counter-cultural lifestyle, attracted many young people and contributed to its success.However, it must also be admitted that Driscoll became a shining star in the new Calvinism surge, and we know that theological depth probably contributed some too. </p>
            <p>However, the church and Driscoll faced a series of controversies and criticisms starting around 2012. The  damaging allegations were related to Driscoll's leadership style, which was described as abusive, authoritarian, and manipulative. Several former pastors and church members spoke out against Driscoll's behavior and the toxic environment within the church.</p>
            <p>As the controversies and internal conflicts continued to escalate, Mars Hill Church began to decline. In August 2014, Driscoll announced that he would take a temporary leave of absence from his pastoral duties to address the issues. In October 2014, a group of Mars Hill pastors submitted formal charges against Driscoll, accusing him of a pattern of abusive and intimidating behavior. Driscoll resigned from his position as lead pastor on October 14, 2014.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, Mars Hill Church announced its dissolution on October 31, 2014, with its individual campuses given the option to become independent or affiliate with other churches. Many of the campuses chose to become independent, while some merged with existing churches or closed entirely. In the years since the fall of Mars Hill Church, Mark Driscoll has re-emerged in ministry, founding The Trinity Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2016. This brings us to the topic for today: how should we think about Driscoll’s fall from ministry, and even now his sudden emergence back into the spotlight? And how much should the church let the cultural narrative define its orthopraxy?  </p>
         
            <h3>The Bible and Leadership Failures: A Response of Grace</h3>
            <p>A murderer, an adulterer, and a coward walk into a bar. No, this isn’t some cheesy joke. It’s actually a reference to Moses, David, and Peter. Okay, maybe they didn’t walk into a bar (Baptists aren’t supposed to drink, right?), but they certainly are guilty of the accusations levied against them. Moses did murder someone. David was an adulterer, but he was a murderer too! And Peter was a coward, denying Jesus and abandoning him when he needed it most. But we could add numerous more examples to this short list. Prostitutes, tax collectors, religious terrorists, liars, you get the pictures. My point here is simply to say people in the Bible, even the leaders in the Bible (some would say ESPECIALLY the leaders in the Bible) were not perfect. And yet, when we think of how the Bible talks about these people, it doesn’t seem quite like the way Mike Kosper and Christianity Today would have spoken about these leaders if they did a podcast on each of them. Let’s look at David, since not only is he the greatest king in Israeliste history, but he is also biologically in the family tree of Jesus. </p>
            <p>Picture the opening line with me: “He slept with a married woman, had her husband, who was a patriot and war hero, killed on the front lines of battle, and then he took the women to be his wife and tried to pretend like nothing happened.” If that headline were scattered across the front page of Christianity Today, the church would be shut down within a week. Because we, as humans, have our own conceptions of grace and punishment, one entirely different from how the Bible treats it. In fact, I would posit we have no concept of what grace is in our day-to-day lives. </p>
            <p>In the Bible, we see the exact opposite of gossip and slander when speaking of the kings of Judah and David. Instead, when referring to them and recollecting their deeds and actions, a grace-filled memory is evident. The biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles indeed present a more positive portrayal of the kings of Israel and Judah, particularly when compared to the accounts found in 1 and 2 Kings. The author of Chronicles, often referred to as the Chronicler, places a greater emphasis on the kings' faithfulness, their adherence to the Davidic covenant, and the temple worship, and not on their failures and shortcomings. </p>
            <p>The grace extended by the Chronicler can be understood in light of the book's context and purpose. Chronicles was likely written after the Babylonian exile, during a time when the people of Israel were returning to their land and rebuilding their national and religious identity. The Chronicler's primary goal was to encourage and inspire the post-exilic community by highlighting the positive aspects of their history and emphasizing God's faithfulness to them.</p>
            <p>By focusing on the successes and acts of faithfulness of the kings, the Chronicler demonstrates God's grace and His willingness to bless and protect His people when they honor Him and follow His commands, and yes, even when the kings fall!. For example, the reigns of King David (1 Chronicles 11-29) and King Solomon (2 Chronicles 1-9) are depicted more favorably in Chronicles than in Kings. The Chronicler highlights their roles in establishing the temple and the Davidic covenant, while downplaying their sins and failures. I like to think the Chronicler understood what grace was. He understood God is a God of second chances, third chances, fourth chances, and so on. For those in Christ (and that is a big qualifier), there is more grace in Christ than there is sin in you. More forgiveness in God than there is failure in you. The death of Christ was so powerful that any sins you committed pre-Christ, and yes, post-Christ, are paid in full. And so you’re covered. You’re forgiven. </p>
            <p>This grace-filled approach serves as a reminder to the post-exilic community that God's covenant promises endure despite the sins and failures of their leaders. It encourages them to seek God wholeheartedly and strive for faithfulness, as they can trust in God's mercy and steadfast love (Lamentations 3:22-23). The Chronicler provides hope and encouragement for the modern Christian, demonstrating that God's promises endure even in the face of human sin and failure.</p>
            <p>So how should Christians respond when a pastor is disqualified from ministry? Should we ignore it and just pretend it didn’t happen? No. Rather, I’d like to approach a better method: why don’t we respond with grace, just like the Chronicler did when speaking of those great men who had fallen. Christians should respond with humility, grace, and discernment when a pastor sins and is potentially disqualified from ministry. Here are some principles to guide the response:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pray for wisdom and guidance: As believers, we should turn to God in prayer, seeking wisdom and understanding in handling such situations (James 1:5). Pray for the pastor involved, the congregation, and the church leadership as they navigate the difficult process. These situations are hardly ever black and white, so we shouldn’t expect a quick and easy solution. Prayer is the best contribution we can make to the people involved.</li>
                <li>Uphold biblical standards: It's crucial to adhere to the biblical qualifications for pastors as outlined in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9. Church leaders should follow the appropriate disciplinary procedures in accordance with Scripture, including confronting the pastor with the accusations and giving him the opportunity to respond (Matthew 18:15-20, 1 Timothy 5:19-20). We should never let the cart come before the horse. There needs to be multiple witnesses if a charge is to be accepted against a pastor.</li>
                <li>Exercise grace and forgiveness, just like the Chronicler: As Christians, we are called to extend grace and forgiveness to others, remembering that we are all sinners saved by grace (Ephesians 4:32). I included the New Testament reference in case you’re one of those Andy Stanley unhitch from the Old Testament types. Don’t worry, there’s forgiveness for you too. </li>
                <li>Prioritize healing and restoration: The ultimate goal should be the restoration of the pastor and the healing of the congregation. If the pastor is truly repentant and willing to undergo a process of restoration, the church should offer support and guidance, keeping in mind that the timeline and outcome may vary depending on the nature of the sin and the specific circumstances (Galatians 6:1).</li>
                <li>Don’t gossip or talk about it. This is sinful. It is poisonous venom you are letting course through your veins if you let it go unchecked. How would you feel if your biggest moments of sin and failures were put on a billboard for all the world to listen to, discuss, and decide how awful of a person you are? Yes, we know you’re an awful person, and so am I. That’s why Jesus had to come and die for us. So stop pretending that this fallen pastor, or Driscoll in this case, is a lower level sinner than you. His justification is just as powerful, his sin washed just as white, as yours. And if none of that convinces you, let me give a few Scriptural proofs that rebuke gossip:
                <ul>
                    <li>"A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends." Proverbs 16:28 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a simple babbler." Proverbs 20:19 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases." Proverbs 26:20 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered." Proverbs 11:13 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD." Leviticus 19:16 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body." Proverbs 18:8 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body." Proverbs 26:22 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear." Ephesians 4:29 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder." 2 Corinthians 12:20 (ESV)</li>
                    <li>"If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless." James 1:26 (ESV)</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ol>
         <p>I write all of this not to discourage, but to encourage. Maybe Mark Driscoll shouldn’t be back in ministry. Maybe he should be. I don’t know, and neither do you. Our job isn’t to police him and gossip about his shortcomings. Rather, we are to submit our lives to the authority of Scripture, and there we find a strong cure, an anti-venom if you will, to the “The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill.” The cure is God’s grace. We should respond with grace. We’ve been saved by grace, and we continue in this Christian life filled with grace. And let’s be honest– if God loved Mark enough to justify him, then he loves him enough to do the same thing for him that he did for David, Moses, Peter, and all the other Christians who have fallen in church history. He loves them enough to restore them and make them whole. Praise God this is theLord we serve.</p>
