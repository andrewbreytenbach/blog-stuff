                    <h2>A Purpose-Driven Pastoral Fallacy</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                   
                    <p>I was perusing the news headlines yesterday when this headline jumped off the page at me: <strong>“Christians who have a problem with women preaching 'have a problem with Jesus'”</strong>. I thought that maybe this would be written by a progressive Christian or liberal professor, but no, those words were uttered by a very popular evangelical leader. I think the only appropriate way to deal with such outlandish claims is to do what I wrote about yesterday– see what the Bible says about it. It is the only source of truth and authority, so I could care less what this “pastor” says on the topic. Let me see what Scripture says. To the inerrant, infallible Word of God we now turn.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 1: Galatians 3:28</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The first passage cited commonly by proponents of an egalitarian theology is Galatians 3:28, which states: "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." They argue that this passage indicates the equality of men and women in the eyes of God, and therefore, women should be allowed to serve as pastors.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        While it is true that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, this passage refers to their equal worth and standing as believers, not their roles in the church. The Apostle Paul, who wrote Galatians, also wrote in 1 Timothy 2:12, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." This passage clearly delineates the roles of men and women in the church, and it is important to interpret Galatians 3:28 within the context of the entire Bible. This is why a proper hermeneutic and not ripping verses out of context is so important.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 2: Acts 18:26</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The second passage commonly cited is Acts 18:26, where Priscilla and her husband Aquila are described as having "explained to [Apollos] the way of God more adequately." The article argues that Priscilla's involvement in teaching Apollos, a prominent early Christian leader, demonstrates the acceptance of women as teachers in the early church, since Apollos went on to become a prominent church leader.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        While Priscilla indeed played a significant role in Apollos' spiritual growth, it is important to note that she did so in partnership with her husband, Aquila. The passage does not imply that Priscilla held a position of authority over Apollos or that she served as a pastor. Rather, it showcases an example of a godly couple working together to build up the church, in line with the complementarian view of men and women's roles. Once again, a further examination of the text proves that this passage does not contradict the larger Scriptural body on this topic.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 3: Romans 16:1-2</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        An additional text which gets thrown into the conversation is Romans 16:1-2, which refers to Phoebe as a "deacon" and a "benefactor of many people, including [Paul]." Then, the position argues that this passage demonstrates that women held leadership positions in the early church and should be allowed to do so today.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        While Phoebe is indeed described as a "deacon," it is important to understand the context and meaning of the term in the early church. The Greek word "diakonos," translated as "deacon," can also mean "servant" or "minister." The role of deacon, as described in the New Testament, involves serving the church in practical ways rather than teaching or exercising authority. As such, Phoebe's role as a deacon does not contradict the complementarian view, but rather, it supports the idea of men and women serving the church in distinct, yet equally important ways. This also does not get into the larger, more prominent view that she was simply just a servant, a view entirely possible and consistent with biblical interpretation (also the position I hold). In that case, Phoebe was just a godly servant, nothing more, and nothing less. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 4: Matthew 28:19-20</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The article also references Matthew 28:19-20, commonly known as the Great Commission: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you." The article suggests that since Jesus issued this command to all of His followers, women should be included in pastoral roles, since women, you know, are also followers of Jesus. I hope you’re beginning to see the pattern here of poor logic, bad argumentation, and hasty conclusions. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        While it is true that the Great Commission is directed to all believers, it does not imply that women should take on pastoral roles. The command to make disciples and teach can be fulfilled in various ways within the church, without requiring a woman to serve as a pastor. Complementarianism acknowledges the importance of women in the discipleship process, particularly in teaching other women and children, in accordance with Titus 2:3-5. Thus, the Great Commission can be fulfilled by both men and women while still maintaining distinct roles within the church. Nowhere does it say women need to teach others in a position of authority. This was not the case, and so Jesus did not feel the need to address that issue here. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 5: John 20:17</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        John 20:17 recounts Jesus' post-resurrection encounter with Mary Magdalene, where He instructs her to "go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" The article I read argues that since Jesus entrusted Mary with the crucial task of announcing His resurrection to the disciples, it demonstrates that women should be allowed to teach and hold pastoral roles, since Mary was the first “apostle”. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        While Jesus did entrust Mary with this important message, it does not mean that her role extends to pastoral leadership. The New Testament is filled with examples of women who played significant roles in the early church, such as Mary Magdalene, Priscilla, and Lydia. However, these roles did not involve pastoral authority or teaching in the context of the local church, as Paul later clarified in 1 Timothy 2:12. It is important to appreciate the value of women's contributions without extending them beyond what the Bible prescribes.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Passage 6: Acts 2 and the Day of Pentecost</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Lastly, the article refers to Acts 2 and the Day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out on all believers, both men and women. The article posits that since the Holy Spirit empowered women to prophesy and speak in tongues, they should also be allowed to serve as pastors, since they were among those who were “teaching” on Pentecost. 
                        
                        While the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on both men and women is a testament to God's gifting, it is important to differentiate between the gift of prophecy and the role of a pastor. Prophecy, as described in the New Testament, is not limited to a specific office or role within the church but is a spiritual gift available to all believers for the edification of the church. In contrast, the pastoral role includes the teaching and governing authority within the local church, which, once again according to 1 Timothy 2:12, is reserved for men. No jury on the planet would hear this counter argument and think there is a case to be made. It would be thrown out of court. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        A careful examination of the passages cited by common proponents of female pastors reveals that this position is flawed and that a complementarian interpretation is consistent with the biblical teachings on the roles of men and women in the church. Notice also that we only dealt with the handful of passages they claim argue for this position. We didn’t touch on the mountain of evidence against their position, but that is an article for another time. While women are indeed equal in worth and spiritual standing with men and have played significant roles throughout the history of the church, the Bible consistently reserves pastoral authority for men. Complementarianism seeks to honor and celebrate the unique ways in which men and women contribute to the body of Christ while upholding the biblical principles that have guided the church throughout history.</p>
