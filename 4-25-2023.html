                    <h2>The Morning Star of the Reformation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>This week, Christians remember the life and legacy of John Wycliffe, affectionately dubbed “the morning star” of the Protestant Reformation.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Why was John Wycliffe called “the morning star” of the Reformation?
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Well, the morning star is not actually a star, but the planet Venus, which appears before the sun rises and while darkness still dominates the horizon. The morning star is unmistakably visible and can be clearly seen, and it is evidence of the future sunrise. In the same way, the life of John Wycliffe gave evidence of the future sunrise that was the Protestant Reformation. Let’s look at his life and see what we can learn.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Early Life and Education:</strong> John Wycliffe (c. 1320-1384) was an English theologian, philosopher, and early advocate for reform within the Catholic Church. Born in the small village of Wycliffe-on-Tees in Yorkshire, England, he received his education at the University of Oxford. He became a Master of Arts in 1356 and later obtained his Doctor of Divinity in 1372. Wycliffe's academic career flourished, and he eventually became the Master of Balliol College and held several other prestigious positions at the university. In other words, he was brilliant by every standard definition of the word. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        <strong>Religious Convictions and Teachings:</strong> Wycliffe's religious convictions were profoundly influenced by his studies in theology. He was a strong advocate for the primacy of Scripture, believing that the Bible should be the ultimate authority in matters of faith and practice. This conviction led him to challenge the Church's teachings and practices that he perceived to be unbiblical. This was the doctrine of sola scriptura before it was formalized in that way.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        His major criticisms of the Catholic Church included:
                        
                        <ul>

                        <li>Clerical abuses and the wealth of the clergy: Wycliffe criticized the wealth and corruption of the clergy and emphasized the importance of a simple, Bible-based lifestyle for all believers. He didn’t think the clergy should lead lavish lifestyles. This is a word for many pastors today as well. </li>
                        
                        <li>Transubstantiation: Wycliffe challenged the doctrine of transubstantiation, arguing that the Eucharist should be understood symbolically rather than literally. John Calvin would carry on this tradition and formalize this doctrine for Reformed congregations. Besides, its just weird to think you’re eating and drinking the LITERAL body and blood of Christ at communion.</li>
                        
                        <li>Papal authority: Wycliffe questioned the authority of the Pope, asserting that only Christ should be recognized as the head of the Church. I mean, this one is a no-brainer if you read the Bible, which Wycliffe did.</li>
                       
                        <li>Bible translation: Wycliffe was a strong advocate for translating the Bible into the common vernacular, which was a revolutionary idea at the time. He believed that the Scriptures should be accessible to everyone, not just the clergy. Thus, he wanted all people to know and treasure the sacred Scriptures, not just the popes, who could then withhold and distort Scripture for the common people.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Wycliffe's Translation of the Bible:</strong> One of Wycliffe's most significant achievements was the translation of the Bible from Latin into Middle English. This effort, undertaken with the help of his followers, known as the Lollards, made Scripture available to a much broader audience. The Wycliffe Bible, as it came to be known, played a pivotal role in the development of the English language and laid the groundwork for future English translations, such as the King James Version. By giving the lay people a Bible they could read, Wycliffe took a major step in debunking the hierarchy of Roman Catholicism. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        <strong>Persecution and Legacy:</strong> Wycliffe's teachings were not well-received by the Catholic Church hierarchy, which doesn’t come as a shock to anyone, and he faced significant opposition throughout his life. Despite this, he remained committed to his convictions and continued to advocate for reform. After his death in 1384, the Catholic Church declared Wycliffe a heretic. Specifically, the Council of Constance (1415), which condemned Jan Hus (another future Reformer) to death, declared Wycliffe a heretic. His bones were exhumed by order of the Queen of England and burned and the ashes were put into the River Swift. Yep- that’s how much they hated and feared the legacy of John Wycliffe in the Catholic Church.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        John Wycliffe's life and work laid the foundation for the Protestant Reformation, which would later challenge the Catholic Church's practices and bring about significant change. Figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin citing his teachings as a significant influence on their own beliefs. His dedication to the primacy of Scripture, translation of the Bible into the common vernacular, and commitment to reform based on Scripture have made him a key figure in Protestant history.
                        
                        For believers today, here are a few major takeaways from the life of Wycliffe:
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        First, whenever you serve God, be willing to stand alone. This is true not only of Wycliffe but of most of the godly men throughout church history. The majority is never right. God plus one makes a majority. Just remember that.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        Second, we will always pay a price to stand alone for God. The kingdom of God is always advanced by the sacrifice of the people of God. Wycliffe knew this and was willing to face suffering in his life for the advancement of the gospel.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Finally, standing alone leads to blessings for others. Though he stood alone, he was able to leave behind a translation of the Bible that meant farmers and tinkers could read the Scriptures for themselves. A legacy such as this is worth enduring suffering. May we be reminded by the life of John Wycliffe what is demanded of us in leading a God-glorifying life.</p>
