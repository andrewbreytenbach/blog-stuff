                    <h2>Theology Thursday #6: God’s Ascribed Glory</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The concept of God's ascribed glory is central to our understanding of His intrinsic glory, which was covered in last week’s article. As we encounter and comprehend God's intrinsic glory, our natural response is to ascribe glory to Him. In this article, we will dive into the theological implications of Habakkuk 2:14 and examine how our understanding of God's ascribed glory shapes our lives, worship, and pursuit of missions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Understanding God's Ascribed Glory</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Habakkuk 2:14 declares that "the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." Here, the Hebrew word for glory, kabod (same word used last week), conveys the idea of weightiness, importance, and honor. The passage emphasizes that recognizing God's honor in the world and ascribing glory to Him is our rightful response to His intrinsic glory. The more we understand God’s intrinsic glory, the more we will ascribe glory to Him. The greater our knowledge of God, the greater our worship of Him will be. A high view of God will invoke high praise for Him. The person who grows to know God more deeply will praise Him more fervently. This is what it means to ascribe glory rightfully to God.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Transformative Knowledge of God's Glory</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The knowledge of God's glory goes beyond intellectual understanding; it encompasses transformational knowledge that permeates our hearts and lives. As we gain a deeper understanding of God's intrinsic glory, our response is to ascribe glory to Him more fervently. This intimate encounter with the glory of God leads to pure, ethical living and a lifestyle consumed with giving God the glory He is due.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ascribing Glory to God in Our Lives, Worship, and Missions</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The theme of ascribing glory to God influences various aspects of our lives:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                    <li>Worship: A high view of God invokes high praise for Him. As we grow in our knowledge of God, our worship becomes more heartfelt and genuine, reflecting our deepening appreciation of His majesty and worthiness.</li>
                    
                    <li>Missions: Our understanding of God's ascribed glory shapes our approach to missions. Spreading the gospel becomes an act of ascribing glory to God, both in our proclamation of His greatness and in inviting others to join us in worshiping Him.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Role of the Church: The Church's primary purpose is to ascribe glory to God through worship, discipleship, and missions. By fulfilling these roles, the Church upholds and proclaims the glory of God in the world.</li>
                    
                    <li>Personal Transformation: As we ascribe glory to God, our lives are transformed. Our actions, relationships, and priorities are increasingly aligned with His will, reflecting His glory in all we do. As the WCF so eloquently said it, the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.</li>
                    
                    <li>Enduring Motivation: Recognizing and ascribing glory to God provides enduring motivation for our spiritual journey. Despite the challenges we face, our focus on God's unchanging glory gives us the strength to persevere and live lives that glorify Him.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Habakkuk 2:14 serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of ascribing glory to God in response to His intrinsic glory. By focusing on the transformative knowledge of God's glory and allowing it to shape our lives, worship, and pursuit of missions, we can ensure that our efforts are rooted in the pursuit of God's honor and praise. As we seek to ascribe glory to God in all things, we find our ultimate purpose and fulfillment in Him. Soli deo gloria!</p>
