            <h2>King Manasseh's Time to Repent</h2>
            <br>
           <p>This will not be a typical op-ed piece for the New York Times or the Washington Post. I’m not going to slander or throw accusations at someone who has already been vilified and desecrated in the public eye. This is simply a biblical call to repentance for a man who is unregenerate and in desperate need of a Savior. I simply want to show some corollaries between our former President’s actions and a similar figure in the Bible. </p>
           <p>The nation of Israel was a nation blessed by God but given human kings to fulfill God’s ultimate eternal purposes. Their human kings were instituted by God to rule over them and protect them, as a means of executing God’s laws on God’s behalf. Unfortunately for Israel, they had both good and righteous kings and very wicked kings. Perhaps the most relevant example of a wicked Israelite king in the Bible, for today’s purposes, is King Manasseh. Manasseh was the son of Hezekiah and the ninth king of Judah, reigning for 55 years from around 687 to 642 BCE. He is described in 2 Kings 21 and 2 Chronicles 33 as having done evil in the sight of the Lord and leading the people of Judah into idolatry and other sins. Did you catch that? Leading the people away from God and towards worship of other things. That’s essentially the definition of idolatry. 
</p>
           <p>Manasseh's reign was characterized by his worship of foreign gods, including Baal and Asherah, and his promotion of pagan practices such as child sacrifice. You could rephrase that sentence as follows: Trump's reign was characterized by his worship of foreign gods, including money and power, and his promotion of pagan practices such as abortion (though we do have Roe v. Wade’s overturn to thank 45 for)  and the LGBTQ movement. He also built altars to these false gods in the temple of the Lord and encouraged the people of Judah to do the same. Again: Trump also built altars to these false gods in the conservative churches of the Lord all across the country and he encouraged Christians to do the same. According to 2 Kings 21:9, Manasseh "led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel." That’s a pretty serious indictment.
</p>
           <p>Despite his wickedness, God sent prophets to warn Manasseh to turn from his evil ways and repent. Despite his wickedness, God sent pastors and Christian leaders to warn the President to turn from his evil ways and repent. However, Manasseh refused to listen and continued to lead the people of Judah in their rebellion against God.  However, Trump refused to listen and continued to lead the people of America in their rebellion against God. As a result, God brought judgment upon him and the nation of Judah. As a result, God brought judgment upon both Mr. Trump and America. Make no mistake, when God wants to judge a nation, he gives them wicked rulers. America, we are under God’s judgment right now.</p>
           <p>In 2 Kings 21:12-15, God declared that He would bring such disaster upon Judah that it would be a proverbial curse to other nations. Manasseh was eventually captured by the Assyrian army and taken into captivity, where he humbled himself before God and repented of his sins. God heard his prayer and restored him to his kingdom, but the damage had already been done, and the people of Judah continued to suffer the consequences of their rebellion for generations to come. Manasseh's story is a warning against the dangers of idolatry and rebellion against God. Despite his wickedness, God extended mercy and grace to Manasseh when he repented, showing that even the most evil of people can find forgiveness through genuine repentance and turning back to God.
</p>
           <p>This is where the story stops being a comparison and begins to be a plea. There is still time for Donald Trump to follow in Manasseh’s footsteps. There is still time for him to humble himself before God and repent of his sins. God will hear his prayer, and though he will not be restored to his office (especially if he broke the law), God will extend mercy and grace to Donald Trump if he repents. This shows that even the most evil of people, the most vile of sinners, can find forgiveness through genuine repentance and turning back to God.
