	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>John Adams, the second president of the United States, is an often-overlooked figure in American history. Although his presidency is often overshadowed by that of his more famous successor, Thomas Jefferson, Adams' life and legacy offer valuable lessons for everyone, but particularly for Christians today. In this article, my aim is to examine the life of John Adams and demonstrate what Christians can learn from his example. But first, we must ask the question: who was John Adams?</p>
	<h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
	<p>He was the eldest of three sons of a farmer and shoemaker born in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1735. Adams attended Harvard College, where he studied law, funded by his father, who sold a portion of the family’s property. Adams quickly established himself as a successful lawyer, becoming involved in several high-profile legal cases, including the defense of British soldiers charged with murder in the Boston Massacre. Adams argued successfully for their acquittal, proving that the soldiers had acted in self-defense. His victory earned him respect and notoriety among the people for his skill and ability in the court of law, and he continued to rise in social prominence.</p>
	<h3>Political Career</h3>
	<p>Adams became more involved in politics, serving as a delegate to the Massachusetts legislature from 1768 to 1774. During this time, he became known for his outspoken opposition to British policies, particularly the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. In 1774, Adams was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in the debate over American independence and solidified his name in history as one of America’s Founding Fathers. Adams was a staunch supporter of independence, arguing that it was the only way for the American colonies to achieve the freedoms they deserved. His determination and perseverance were critical in convincing his fellow delegates to support the Declaration of Independence.</p>
	<h3>Contributions to the United States</h3>
	<p>Adams' contributions to the fledgling United States did not end with the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. He went on to serve as the first vice president of the United States under George Washington and later became the second president of the United States. Adams was also heavily involved in the American Revolution itself, serving on various committees to provide supplies and troops for the Continental Army. He was a skilled diplomat, and his efforts in this area played a significant role in the ultimate success of the Revolution. One of his most notable achievements in this regard was his role in negotiating the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war with Britain and recognized the United States as an independent nation. The treaty was ultimately signed on September 3, 1783, and Adams' role in negotiating it was crucial, recognized by his fellow Americans.</p>
	<h3>Later Years and Legacy</h3>
	<p>After leaving office, Adams spent his later years in retirement at his farm in Massachusetts. He remained active in politics and continued to correspond with his fellow Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson. In one of their most famous exchanges, Adams and Jefferson reconciled after years of political rivalry, and their correspondence became a symbol of the importance of civility and mutual respect in American politics.</p>
	<p>However, his contributions to American democracy and his commitment to liberty and justice continued to inspire future generations of Americans. As he wrote in a letter to his wife Abigail, "I must study politics and war so that my sons may have the liberty to study mathematics and philosophy."</p>
	<h3>John Adams: Christian Nationalist?</h3>
	<p>John Adams' religious views were influenced by his upbringing in a devout Calvinistic Protestant family. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, and Adams himself was raised in this faith. Throughout his life, Adams remained deeply committed to his religious beliefs, which played a significant role in shaping his worldview and his approach to politics. Indeed, it could be argued that Adams was something of a founding Christian nationalist.</p>
	<p>Adams' Calvinistic Protestant beliefs emphasized the importance of hard work, individual responsibility, and moral purity. He believed that individuals had a responsibility to use their talents and abilities to serve others and to uphold the values of their community and the nation in which they lived.</p>
	<p>For the entirety of his life, Adams remained deeply rooted in his Calvinistic Protestant beliefs. He believed that individuals had a duty to use their talents and abilities to serve others and to promote the common good. As he wrote in a letter to his wife Abigail, "Public business, my dear, must always be done by somebody. It will be done by somebody or another. If wise men decline it, others will not; if honest men refuse it, others will not." Thus, we see the burden John Adams felt to use his gifts and abilities to serve his nation, ultimately for the glory of God.</p>
	<p>So, it seems logical for us today, living under the government John Adams founded, to reflect back and see what Christian principles can be deducted from the life John Adams lived.</p>
	<h2>10 Takeaways for the Christian from the Life of John Adams</h2>
        <p><em>First, we can learn from Adams' commitment to biblical principles.</em> As Christians, our commitment to biblical principles is essential to living a godly life and making a positive impact on the world. John Adams serves as a powerful example of this, demonstrating a steadfast commitment to biblical values and principles throughout his life. </p> 
        <p>His opposition to slavery, despite its widespread acceptance in his time, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for justice and righteousness, even in the face of opposition. In a world where many voices compete for our attention and influence, it is crucial that we remain committed to biblical principles, which provide a solid foundation for our faith and guide us in our daily lives.</p> 
        <p>The Christian must emphasize the importance of submitting to the authority of Scripture, recognizing that God's Word is the ultimate authority in our lives. We must be committed to studying and applying the Bible in our daily lives, seeking to live in accordance with its teachings and principles. Moreover, our commitment to biblical principles should motivate us to live lives of service and humility, following the example of Jesus who came not to be served but to serve (Matthew 20:28).</p> 
        <p>John Adams' commitment to biblical principles serves as a reminder of the importance of staying true to our faith and living lives of conviction and courage. As Christians, we must remain committed to the authority of Scripture, living lives of service and humility, and using our gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world. By doing so, we can fulfill our calling to be the salt and light of the world, bringing hope and healing to a world in need.</p> 
        
        <p><em>Second, we can learn from the humility of John Adams.</em> John Adams' humility throughout his life is a lesson for Christians to live a humble life of service, using their gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world rather than seeking personal glory and acclaim.</p>  
        <p>John Adams' humility is a shining example for Christians to follow. In a world that often values self-promotion and personal glory, Adams' commitment to service and putting the needs of others first is a refreshing reminder of what it means to live a humble life.</p>
        <p>The Bible emphasizes the need for humility, recognizing that all that we have and all that we are comes from God. Philippians 2:3-8 teaches that we should consider others better than ourselves, following the example of Christ, who humbled Himself and became obedient to death on the cross. Romans 12:3-8 similarly reminds us not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought and to use our gifts for the good of the body, recognizing that we are all members of one another. By following Christ's example of humility and service, we can bring glory to God and demonstrate His love to others. As James 4:6 teaches, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." Therefore, humility and service are essential to living a godly life.</p> 
        <p>John Adams' humility and commitment to service can inspire Christians to prioritize serving others and using their gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world, rather than seeking personal glory and acclaim. As we follow Christ's example of humility and service, we can reflect the love and grace of God to those around us and bring glory to His name.</p> 
        
        <p><em>Third, we can learn from his civic engagement.</em> Citizenship is a sacred duty, one that requires our active participation in the political process. John Adams understood this well and believed that every citizen had a duty to uphold the values of freedom and democracy. As Christians, we too are called to be active participants in our communities, promoting the common good through our involvement in politics and civic life. </p>
        <p>Civic engagement is essential to being salt and light in the world, working towards justice, equality, and the betterment of society. We are called to submit to governing authorities and to be good citizens of our respective countries. This means being informed about the issues facing our communities and actively seeking to make a positive impact in the world. Furthermore, as Christians, we have a responsibility to do good to all people and to work towards the common good. Being involved in politics and civic life can take many forms, such as voting, volunteering, and advocating for policies and causes that align with Christian values. By being active participants in our communities and upholding the values of freedom, justice, and democracy, we can make a positive impact in the world and reflect the love of Christ to those around us. </p>
        <p>In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Romans 13:1). This verse emphasizes the importance of submitting to governing authorities and recognizing that they have been established by God. In his letter to the Galatians, Paul wrote, "So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith" (Galatians 6:10). This verse highlights the importance of doing good to all people, recognizing that we have a responsibility to work towards the common good.</p>
        <p>As Christians, we can make a difference in the world by being active participants in the political process and promoting the values of freedom, justice, and democracy. We can also be advocates for those who are marginalized and oppressed, working towards a more just and equitable society. </p>
        <p>John Adams' belief in civic engagement remains relevant today, and Christians can similarly embrace this call to participate in the political process and work towards the common good. By being active citizens and upholding the values of freedom, justice, and democracy, we can make a positive impact in the world and reflect the love of Christ to those around us.</p>
        
        <p><em>Fourth, we may learn from his view of biblical justice.</em> John Adams was a man of unwavering integrity and honesty, who believed in the importance of a just and fair legal system. As Christians, we are called to pursue justice and promote fairness and equality in our communities, just as Adams did in his time. Justice is a crucial aspect of God's character, and we too are called to do justice and love mercy (Micah 6:8). </p>
        <p>The book of Proverbs reminds us that the righteous care about justice for the poor, and Jesus Himself championed justice and fairness in His ministry on earth. He proclaimed the year of the Lord's favor to set the oppressed free, to proclaim good news to the poor, and to recover sight for the blind. In essence, He was a champion of social justice, and as His followers, we should emulate His example. </p>
        <p>In today's culture, John Adams might even be considered by some on the far end to be "woke" as he championed the marginalized and vulnerable in society. He believed that every person, regardless of their social status or wealth, should have equal access to justice and that laws should be applied equally to all. As Christians, we should likewise be committed to promoting fairness and equality in our communities, advocating for policies that uplift the disadvantaged and using our voices and resources to bring about positive change. </p>
        <p>John Adams' commitment to justice and the rule of law remains relevant today, and we, as Christians, should follow his example by standing up for what is right and reflecting the love and justice of God to those around us. Let us be champions of justice, just as Jesus was, and let us work towards a more just and equitable world, for the glory of God.</p>
        
        <p><em>Fifth, we can learn from Adams' commitment to peacemaking and reconciliation.</em> John Adams' commitment to peacemaking and reconciliation is an essential lesson that we, as Christians, can learn from today. Despite his pivotal role in the American Revolution, Adams recognized the importance of negotiating a peaceful settlement with Britain. As followers of Christ, we too are called to be peacemakers, working towards building bridges between people and communities and promoting healing and reconciliation in the midst of conflict.</p>
        <p>The Bible teaches that peace is a fruit of the Holy Spirit and that we should pursue it with all people. Peacemaking is central to the Christian life, and those who actively work towards peace and reconciliation are fulfilling God's purpose for their lives. Jesus Himself said, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God," (Matthew 5:9). Additionally, the theme of reconciliation is central to the Gospel message. God reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. Our salvation is based on reconciliation, between God and humanity.</p>
        <p>As Christians, we can promote peacemaking and reconciliation in our communities first and foremost by sharing the gospel with others. Even when this does not lead to their salvation, we may also spread the gospel and promote reconciliation by seeking the good of our neighbor and caring for them. </p>
        <p>John Adams' recognition of the importance of negotiating a peaceful settlement with Britain serves as a reminder that peacemaking and reconciliation are essential for building a just and peaceful society. As followers of Christ, let us actively work towards peace and reconciliation in our communities, recognizing that these are central themes of the Gospel message and reflective of God's character and purpose.</p>
        
        <p><em>Sixth, Christians can learn from Adams' principle of human freedom.</em> Adams' commitment to freedom and independence should inspire Christians to value the principles of human freedom, and to be advocates for human rights and dignity for all people. And no, this section is not referring to salvific freedom. We’re slaves to sin, so there’s no freedom apart from the unconditional electing grace of God in Christ. Now that we’ve gotten that objection out of the way, let’s keep moving.</p>
        <p>John Adams' unwavering commitment to freedom and independence should inspire Christians to value the principles of liberty and self-determination. Adams recognized that freedom is an essential component of a just and democratic society, and his belief in these principles played a critical role in the founding of the United States. As Christians, we too should value the principles of human freedom and recognize that every person is created in the image of God with inherent dignity and worth. We are also reminded that Christ came to set us free from sin and death, and that we are to use our freedom to serve others and live in righteousness. In Galatians 5:1, Paul wrote, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery." This verse emphasizes that Christ has set us free and that we are to use our freedom to stand firm in our faith and serve others who cannot do so for themselves.</p>
        <p>We can promote freedom and independence in our communities by advocating for policies and practices that protect human rights and worth. We should work to end oppression and exploitation and support Christian organizations that promote justice and equality. Sorry BLM, but you’re not one of those. We can also be advocates for the freedom and independence of those who are oppressed or marginalized, recognizing that true freedom is not just the absence of external constraints, but also the ability to live fully and flourish as human beings.</p>
        <p>John Adams' commitment to freedom and independence should inspire us as Christians to value the principles of liberty and self-determination. Let us be advocates for human rights and dignity for all people, recognizing that every person is created in the image of God and possesses inherent dignity and worth. Let us use our freedom to serve others and promote justice and equality, standing firm in our faith and reflecting the love and justice of Christ to those around us.</p>
        
        <p><em>Seventh, we can learn from Adam's pursuit of education and knowledge.</em> As Christians, we are called to be lifelong learners and to cultivate our minds in pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. John Adams, a man of great intellect and leadership, recognized the importance of education and intellectual curiosity for personal growth, good leadership, and the success of a nation. He believed that knowledge and wisdom were essential for the betterment of society, and this belief is equally true for Christians today.</p>
        <p>The pursuit of knowledge is not only important for our personal growth and development, but also for our understanding of God's creation. The Bible teaches that wisdom is a gift from God, and we are to seek it with all our hearts. The book of Proverbs emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding, and of using wisdom to make good decisions and live a virtuous life. As we deepen our understanding of God's creation and the world around us, we can develop a greater appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the world, inspiring us to be better stewards of the earth and to work towards the common good of all people.</p>
        <p>We can cultivate our minds through a variety of means, including reading books, attending lectures, engaging in intellectual discussions, and pursuing formal education. By doing so, we can develop the skills and knowledge needed to serve others and make a positive impact on the world. However, we must remember that the pursuit of knowledge should not be for personal gain or self-promotion but for the glory of God and for the benefit of others.</p>
        <p>In the context of ministry, reading and studying the Bible is of utmost importance. Pastors and teachers must have a thorough understanding of the Scriptures and be able to effectively communicate it to their congregations. They should also be knowledgeable of other disciplines, such as history, theology, and apologetics, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world and its people. As John Wesley once said, "Read, or get out of the ministry."</p>
        <p>John Adams' pursuit of education and knowledge should inspire Christians to value the pursuit of wisdom and to cultivate their minds. By doing so, we can deepen our understanding of the world and of God's creation and use our knowledge and wisdom to serve others and make a positive impact on the world. Let us never stop learning and seeking wisdom, for it is a gift from God that can enrich our lives and bring glory to His name.</p>
        
        <p><em>Eighth, we can learn from how Adams' interacted with his family and friends.</em> We can learn so much from the life of John Adams, especially when it comes to how he interacted with his family and friends. Adams' love for his wife, Abigail, was legendary, and he valued his relationships above all else. As Christians, we can likewise prioritize our relationships and seek to love and serve our families and communities with selflessness and generosity. </p>
        <p>The Bible teaches that relationships are foundational to a healthy and fulfilling life, and we are called to love one another as Christ loved us. This means putting others' needs before our own and serving them with compassion and humility. We can also seek guidance and support from family members and close friends, recognizing that they are sources of wisdom and comfort in our lives. Paul, in his letter to the Ephesians, emphasized the importance of selflessness, recognizing that a strong and healthy relationship requires sacrifice and love.</p>
        <p>We can prioritize our relationships by investing time and effort into our families, friendships, and communities. We can serve others with generosity and compassion, and seek to resolve conflicts and build bridges of understanding and empathy between people. Moreover, as we prioritize our relationships, we can develop a deeper appreciation for the love and grace of God. Our relationships with others are a reflection of our relationship with Him. Jesus emphasized the importance of loving others and putting their needs above our own, saying, "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35). </p>
        <p>John Adams' commitment to family and relationships serves as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing our relationships and seeking to love and serve others with selflessness and generosity. Let us invest in our families, friendships, and communities, and live out the principles of love and grace in all that we do. May we reflect the love of God to those around us, and may our relationships be a source of joy and blessing to others.</p>
        
        <p><em>Ninth, we may learn from Adams' commitment to persevere.</em> As we reflect on the life of John Adams, we are reminded of the importance of perseverance and resilience in navigating the challenges and setbacks of life. Adams faced numerous obstacles throughout his life, both personal and political, but he remained steadfast in his commitment to his beliefs and his goals. As Christians, we too face trials and difficulties, but we can draw strength from our faith and the promises of God.</p>
        <p>The Bible teaches us that perseverance is essential for the Christian life, as we navigate the trials and challenges of this world. We are called to trust in God's faithfulness and provision, even in the midst of difficult circumstances. We can draw strength from the support and encouragement of our families, friends, and faith communities, knowing that we are not alone in our struggles. Furthermore, as we persevere through difficult times, we can become a source of encouragement and inspiration to others, reflecting the love and grace of God to those around us. We can support and encourage one another, lifting each other up and being a source of strength and inspiration to those in need</p>
        <p>As we cultivate perseverance and resilience, we can deepen our faith and character, becoming more mature and complete as we trust in God's purposes for our lives. We can become a testament to God's faithfulness and love, persevering through trials and difficulties and emerging stronger and more steadfast in our commitment to Him. Ultimately, we persevere not because of any one of these reasons, but foremost due to our knowledge of God’s sovereignty. If we simply had those other things, but not God’s sovereignty, we would be hopeless. Knowing God is in control is the bedrock assurance we have, and by relying on that promise as well as faithful family and friends, we can persevere. </p>
        <p>John Adams' commitment to perseverance and resilience serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting in God's provision and grace, and of cultivating perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. As Christians, we can draw strength from our faith and the support of others, and persevere through difficult times, knowing that God is faithful and that he will provide for our needs.</p>
        
        <p><em>Finally, we may learn from Adams' legacy and impact.</em> Let us consider his legacy and the impact he made on the world. John Adams was a man who left a lasting impression on history, demonstrating the power of one person to make a difference in the world. As Christians, we too are called to be agents of change in the world, using our gifts and talents to serve others and bring glory to God. </p>
        <p>John Adams believed in the importance of service, justice, and equality. He fought for independence and democracy, and he worked tirelessly to build a nation that valued liberty and human dignity. As Christians, we can follow his example by using our gifts and abilities to make a lasting impact on the world, working towards the ultimate end of all things, namely the glory of God. Jesus himself emphasized the importance of service and making a difference in the world. He said, "Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Matthew 20:26-28). This verse highlights the importance of humility and service in the Christian life, recognizing that true greatness is found in serving others. It emphasizes that a legacy is not in what you accomplish for yourself, but rather in what you do for God. It demonstrates that a powerful impact is not in how much you do, per say, but in what you do. The quality of our work here matters greatly, and the quality must be of a self-forsaking, self-denying type. In other words, the way up is down. If you want to be great, become nothing for the sake of Christ.</p>
        <p>John Adams' life and legacy serve as a reminder of the power of one person to make a difference in the world. As Christians, let us be inspired by his example and use our gifts and talents to serve others and bring glory to God. Not so we can make a name for ourselves. But so that we might decrease as Christ increases, and that through this toil and struggle we might save some via the good news of the gospel. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Now, let me bring this already far too long inaugural blog post to a tumbling close, and no, I do not plan to restate everything that has already been stated earlier in the article. This is a legitimate, standalone conclusion, made especially for those of you who skimmed and skipped most of the content and just came here for the summary so you can have a talking point at your next coffee shop accountability group.</p> 
        <p>John Adams' life and legacy offer countless valuable lessons for Christians today. From his commitment to biblical principles and justice to his advocacy for civic engagement and the need to be present with one’s family relationships, Adams' example challenges us to live lives of courage, conviction and humility. As Christians, we can learn from Adams' legacy and seek to embody his values in our own lives. Ultimately, we imitate not Adams, but Christ. By following in his footsteps, we can work to build a more godly society. May we be inspired by the life of John Adams and strive to make a positive impact on the world around us, guided by our faith and a commitment to the glory of God.</p>
