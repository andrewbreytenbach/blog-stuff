            <h2>When Boys Play With Girls</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p>As I was enjoying my morning double shot of espresso, I stumbled across an article on the front page of the BBC world news titled “World Athletics bans transgender women from competing in female world ranking events” and the first thought that popped into my head was “Thank the Lord! Finally, some common sense.” And then I got to thinking about what a headline like that says about the larger cultural moment about the transgender movement. So, enjoy your morning cup of coffee and keep reading. </p>
            <p>I believe in the inherent dignity and value of every human life. We are all created in the image of God, and that image is not dependent on our physical characteristics or abilities. But, God was the one who made each of us in His image. And God doesn’t make mistakes. God is a master craftsman, and I don’t want to stand anywhere near the person on judgment day who has the audacity to tell the Creator of the World he made a mistake. This, in a nutshell, is the problem with the transgender issue. It is rebellion directly in the face of Sovereign God. </p>
            <p>The issue of transgender athletes has been a topic of much debate in recent years, with many arguing that transgender individuals should be allowed to compete in sports according to their gender identity. That idea is simply ludicrous.</p>
            <p>First and foremost, it is essential to recognize the undeniable biological distinctions that exist between men and women. These differences manifest in various physiological aspects, such as hormonal balances, muscle mass, and overall body composition. Men typically possess elevated levels of testosterone, a hormone responsible for promoting the development of male secondary sexual characteristics and contributing to greater muscle mass. This characteristic provides men with a clear competitive edge in sports that demand significant strength, power, and speed.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, women have a unique hormonal makeup, primarily characterized by the presence of estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play a vital role in the development and regulation of female secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive functions. Additionally, women tend to have a higher percentage of body fat and less muscle mass compared to men, which can impact their performance in certain athletic endeavors.</p>
            <p>Let me make this really simple: if the fastest male swimmer in the world and the fastest female swimmer in the world competed against one another, the female wouldn’t even compete against the male. They are categorically different in terms of physiological compositon. That’s what it means to be distinctly male and female. </p>
            <p>It is due to these fundamental biological differences that sports competitions have traditionally been divided into separate categories for men and women, and it wasn’t until the madness of the sexual revolution that culture tried to challenge this perfectly normal idea. This division helps to level the playing field and ensure fair competition among athletes. We wouldn’t let a 25 year old male athlete go back and compete in middle school basketball, would we? No! And we certainly wouldn’t let him tell us he identifies as a middle schooler, because you can’t change time. And guess what… you can’t change gender either. That’s how ridiculous this is. </p>
            <p>By acknowledging and respecting these distinctions of male and female, we can create an environment that not only celebrates the unique abilities of both men and women (women are amazing because they are women, and men are amazing because they are men) but also fosters a sense of inclusivity and equal opportunity within the realm of competitive sports.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is vital to consider the potential consequences for other athletes when considering the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports competitions. Permitting transgender individuals to participate in categories that do not align with their biological sex will create an uneven playing field, which will certainly demoralize and deter other competitors from pursuing their athletic dreams. This issue may be particularly detrimental for young, hopeful athletes who are in the early stages of their sporting journey, as they could find themselves disheartened by the apparent scarcity of opportunities to excel and showcase their talents. No little girl will want to compete against a confused boy who couldn’t cut it in the boys league and is now beating up the girls basketball league. And no little girl should have to compete against a boy. She wasn’t created to. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is essential to weigh the broader societal implications of the ongoing discourse surrounding transgender athletes and sports participation. In recent times, our culture has witnessed an expanding acceptance of the notion that gender is a social construct, and individuals possess the autonomy to determine their own gender identity. However, this is cultural insanity, mutiny, and rebellion. </p>
            <p>Sodom and Gomorrah would be appalled at the madness ensuing within the Western Hemisphere in today’s day and age. America has invented new ways for people to sin that no other society has in the entire history of humanity. America, the warnings have been issued. We have been told of the wickedness and called to repent. If we do not repent, there will be a day when fire and brimstone rain down from heaven as God pours out his wrath on the wicked rebellion. On that day, it won’t matter if the transgender athlete is running next to a female, male, or in a new category of transgender athletes, because God’s wrath will destroy all unrepentant sinners. It’s an equal opportunity judgment. So repent, and turn to Christ. </p>
            <p>Until then, for the Christian, may the Lord hasten His return. Maranatha. </p>
