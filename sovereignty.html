            <h2>Theology Thursday #3</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Today’s Thursday, which means you’ll be getting your weekly dose of theology. Today’s attribute of God is the sovereignty of God. The big idea for today: God reigns over all people, over all places, for all time. Be warned, this is part 1 of 2, since the passage I want to look at is way too dense (code for 'long') for just one blog post. </p>
            <p>No doctrine is more despised by the fallen human mind than the truth that God is absolutely sovereign. Human pride loathes the suggestion that God orders everything, controls everything, and rules over everything. The carnal mind, burning with enmity against God, abhors the biblical teaching that nothing comes to pass except according to His eternal decrees. </p>
            <p>Why does this matter so much? Why does what we believe about God’s sovereignty matter?</p>
            <p>It is a telling attribute of God. Meaning, if you tell me what someone believes about the sovereignty of God, I can tell you what they believe about a lot of other areas of theology. </p>
            <p>And right off the bat, let me just put my cards on the table. I believe in a really big God. I believe in a really sovereign God. All powerful. Completely in control. No maverick molecules. Perfectly, sovereignly working out his purposes in the world for the sake of his glory. </p>
            <p>And what you believe about this doctrine matters greatly. It affects how you pray. It affects how you share the gospel. It affects how you go through a season of suffering. It affects how you live your life on a day to day basis. It gives us confidence, not fear.</p>
            <p>So, let me establish a truth claim, then explain what I mean by it, and then we’ll dive into the text.  </p>
            <h4>1. Truth Claim: God is sovereign.</h4>
            <p>Meaning there is no such thing as chance or blind fate. Proverbs 16:33 tells us “the lot is cast into the lap, but every decision is from the Lord.” This is not just the witness or the testimony of proverbs but also the resounding consensus from the rest of Scripture. </p>
            <p>Isaiah 46:9-11 “My purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all my good pleasure. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, surely I will do it.” </p>
            <p>Now, we turn to defining it. So what is the sovereignty of God?</p>
            
            <h4>2. Explanation: What is the sovereignty of God?</h4>
            <p>A sovereign being, in the biblical use of the term, is a ruler, a king, a lord. Scripture often refers to God as the one who rules over all. </p>
            <p>Everyone else is ‘a’ sovereign’… God is ‘the sovereign’… God is the supreme sovereign being in the Bible. </p>
            <p>Therefore, there are no limits to God’s rule. It is a limitless sovereignty. This is part of what it means to be God. He is sovereign over the whole world, and everything that happens in it. He is never helpless, never frustrated, never at a loss. Sovereignty is God’s control or ordering of all events and outcomes to the purpose of his will and his own glory. Whenever God acts, he acts in a way that pleases him. God is never constrained to do a thing that he despises. He is never backed into a corner where his only recourse is to do something he hates to do. He does whatever he pleases.</p>
            <p>God's sovereignty simply refers to the fact that all things are under His rule and control, and that nothing happens in this Universe without His direction or permission. He is a God Who works, not just some things, but all things after the counsel of His own will (see Eph. 1:11). God's purpose is all- inclusive and is never thwarted (see Isa. 46:11). Nothing takes Him by surprise.</p>
            <p>God does what he wants, when he wants, where he wants, with who he wants, how he wants.</p>
            <p>God either reigns or he doesn’t. He either rules… or he is ruled. The biblical position is that we serve and worship a God who certainly reigns and rules over all of creation. </p>
            <p>Our text today, Psalm 89, is written in the form of Hebrew poetry. It uses figurative, metaphorical language to convey a message. Much of the psalm is written in parallelism, meaning that the first line makes a statement, and then the second line restates what was said above in a different way, to reinforce the idea being communicated. </p>
            <p>For example: The heavens declare the glory of God; all the earth proclaims his handiwork. Both lines are saying the same thing. Essentially what you need to know is that the lines work together in order to prove the same point. </p>
            <p>First, in verse 6, we see:</p>
            
            <h4>God’s sovereignty makes him incomparable. (v. 6)</h4>
            <p>"For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD"</p>
            <p>The psalmist raises the question to anyone who will hear and listen, from the host of heaven to the earth below. It’s a rhetorical question, meaning that the answer is so obvious, so abundantly clear, that no one needs to even open their mouths to give an answer. </p>
            <p>Who can be compared to God? The root word for compare has the idea of something being set out, laid out in comparison to. It would be like laying down an authentic $20 bill and then another bill, to determine whether or not the $20 is a real one or a counterfeit. In a similar fashion, but taken up another level, is that there is not even a counterfeit in the universe to be laid out to be compared to God. Nothing comes close to even being able to be put up against who God is.</p>
            <p>In the Hebrew parallel fashion, the next line asks the same question, but, as we would expect, rephrases it in a slightly different way. The word ‘like’ here asks the question of resemblance or comparison, but with a different analogy. This meaning, this question, is one of a doppelgänger. Is there anyone in the known universe who could be mistaken for God? Again, very similar to the counterfeit, but restated in a different way. </p>
            <p>The clear, resounding answer, roaring from the silence, is that no one, nothing, no being, in all of the universe is able to match up. No one will step up into the ring to match up, and no one is even able to. God is all by himself, matchless. He is unable to be compared. God’s sovereignty is incomparable. </p>
            
            <h4>God’s sovereignty makes him terrifying. (v. 7)</h4>
            <p>"a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him?"</p>
            <p>As we will see, many of the attributes of God overlap, not conflicting or competing with one another but enhancing the beauty and the perfection of each attribute. So, here, we see the terror of God’s sovereignty. The dreadful fear, the respectful fear, that must come upon those who desire to praise God. </p>
            <p>Here the psalmist says that God is so powerful that He is greatly to be feared. The translation literally means that among all of the heavenly beings and among all of the redeemed saints in heaven, God is chief among them to be afraid of, in awe of. </p>
            <p>The next line fills this in even more. The word ‘awesome’ comes from the root word to being afraid of- meaning because God is awesome, because God is sovereign, he should be feared. The heavenly host surrounding the throne of God in heaven cannot help but throw themselves down in fear and awe and surrender in light of the power and greatness of God. </p>
            <p>And we know that the fear of the Lord, a healthy fear of who God is, is not only necessary but has very real and practical implications for how we approach God and worship Him. </p>
            <p>A sovereign being who is all powerful rightly should strike us mortal creatures with a healthy sense of fear. </p>
            
            <h4>God’s sovereignty demonstrates God is steadfast. (v. 8)</h4>
            <p>"O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you?"</p>
            <p>Here we see that God’s sovereignty is permeated with steadfastness, with covenant faithfulness, with trustworthiness. These are two aspects of the nature of God that cannot be separated. They are intertwined with one another. God is mighty, and since he is mighty, he is able to and he will remain faithful to his covenant promises. </p>
            <p>And in Christ, God’s awesome, sovereign providence is the place we feel most reverent, most secure, most free.  It is the place where we see God’s faithfulness most clearly.</p>
            <p>God’s sovereignty and his steadfastness is seen most perfectly at the cross.  Acts 2:23 says, “this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.” The crucifixion of Christ is a perfect example of this. The greatest injustice in history was carried out by evil men; yet it happened according to God’s “definite plan and foreknowledge.” God was working out his purposes, his covenant promises, through his authority and his power. God was always in complete control of the whole situation. From the promise in Genesis 3:15 up until the stone from the tomb was rolled away and Jesus walked out; not a second of that time, not an action that took place, was outside of God’s sovereignty. </p>
            
            <p>Like I said earlier, this was part 1/2. Next week we'll finish the rest of the study on God's sovereignty, but for now, don't do anything. Reflect. Meditate. Think. Rejoice. Praise. Worship. This is what a right view of God's sovereignty will evoke in us. </p>
