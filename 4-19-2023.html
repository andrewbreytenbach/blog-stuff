                    <h2>The Call to Rediscover God-Given Masculinity: Rejecting Modernity's Flawed Vision
                    </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>In a world that has become increasingly captivated by the allure of progress, there is an urgent need for men to resist and defy the false narratives that threaten to undermine their very essence. Men have long been subjected to a distorted perception of masculinity in today's society, which emphasizes superficial and feminine traits and often leads to confusion, loss of identity and purpose, and unhappiness. This article calls on men to reject the flawed, pagan vision of modernity and embrace their God-given masculinity in order to create a place for future generations to thrive in.</p>

                    <strong><p>The Distorted Perception of Masculinity</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The modern era has ushered in a multitude of technological advancements and new ways of thinking. While many of these developments have been beneficial, they have also given rise to a distorted perception of masculinity. That was a nice way of putting it. It has given rise to the all-out rejection of masculinity. This secular vision emphasizes embracing “who you are” and denying the God-given desires and traits men feel. Society says it is wrong and harmful for boys to fight when they are kids. God says this is how boys learn what they should protect, and one day they will use those traits to protect their family. Society says men aren’t the only ones supposed to lead. God says men are to lead their households and families well. Society says there is no difference between boys and girls. God (and biology) disagree with society on that one too. And I could keep going with this. Society encourages men to engage in feminine behaviors that harm themselves and others, ultimately fostering a culture of isolation, darkness, emptiness, not only within themselves but the larger society. It is no wonder that if you look around at the world today, you will see this playing out.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>The Importance of Embracing God-Given Masculinity</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Rejecting modernity's false narrative is vital for men to rediscover and embrace their God-given masculinity. God-given masculinity is characterized by values such as integrity, courage, responsibility, and wisdom. It is characterized by fighting for what is right and standing up for the oppressed. It is characterized by loving your wife (yes, a man should have a wife) and raising godly children. It is characterized by working hard at the vocation the Lord has given you to steward. More than these, it means bowing in submission to the lordship of Jesus Christ. This is the most unpopular message of “toxic masculinity”. By cultivating these qualities, men can develop a strong society that honors God and puts the nuclear family back together. In short, when men do what God intended them to do, we will thrive.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>Creating and Cultivating</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>As men reject the castrated values of modern manhood and embrace their God-given masculinity, they can contribute to the betterment of society as cultivators and creators. Since the creation of man in the garden, we have been called to cultivate and create. Men who create a product or service in order to provide for their families. Men create a family by finding a wife, loving her as Christ loved the church, and bringing children into the world. Men come together to create communities of God-honoring nuclear families. These communities come together to create societies, and these societies create culture. A man is by nature a creator and a cultivator. Once they have created, their job is to tend and cultivate what they have made. The job of a man is not a one-and-done mission. It is a daily task of managing and stewarding what is theirs. This is the God-given command for men to create a strong family, community, and society.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>In a world where modernity has given rise to a distorted vision of masculinity, it is essential for men to reject these superficial ideals and embrace their God-given masculinity. By doing so, they can cultivate a stronger sense of self, build lasting relationships, and make a positive impact on society. It is through this authentic expression of masculinity that men can find true fulfillment and purpose in life as a means of glorifying the God who made them.</p>
