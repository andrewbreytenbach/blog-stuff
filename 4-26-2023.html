                    <h2>The Lunacy of Liberalism</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                
                    <p>I took a nice little road trip yesterday. As I had lots of time on my hands to think and ponder the deeper and more impactful issues pressing upon society, and I only felt it would be natural to wake up this morning and share the thoughts I had as I drove down the poorly constructed highway and hit pothole after pothole. Here's the gist of this entire blog– I am deeply concerned with the leftward trends I see in society. In fact, they terrify me. In my view, there are severe dangers associated with a morally liberal, progressive, and I daresay even a perverse society that undermines traditional conservative values, which is what I think we ought to return to.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        One of the key dangers of a morally liberal society is the erosion of the family unit. Traditional conservative (and biblical) values emphasize the importance of strong families as the foundation of a stable and prosperous society. However, the liberal agenda has sought to redefine the family, often at the expense of the traditional nuclear family. For example, Black Lives Matter used to proudly display on their website that one of their values was the destruction of the nuclear family. The promotion of alternative family structures such as same-sex parenting, cohabitation, and single parenthood, while presented as inclusive and progressive, will ultimately undermine the stability of the family unit and its ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Another danger of a morally liberal society is the promotion of a victim culture. You don’t have to go very far to see the rise of this among the Gen Z population. The focus on identity politics and the elevation of individual identities and rights above the common good can lead to a society that is deeply divided and lacks a shared sense of purpose. The progressive agenda always, as a staple, encourages individuals to view themselves as victims, leading to a sense of entitlement and a lack of personal responsibility. This can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion and a decrease in the sense of community that is necessary for a healthy and functioning society. Plus, it creates a bunch of babies, and not the kind you need for procreation. That’s going down because of the rise in LGBTQ relationships. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        A morally liberal society can also be detrimental to individual freedom and prosperity. The promotion of collectivist ideologies, such as socialism, communism, Marxism, and critical theory, under the guise of progressivism, can lead to government intervention in every aspect of individual life and is actually a severe form of repression and regression. This can result in a lack of economic freedom and personal autonomy, as well as a decrease in the incentives for innovation, creativity, and hard work. Let’s be honest– why would straight, white, Christian want to do anything if they get blamed for every problem in society?
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Moreover, a morally liberal society can be detrimental to public safety. The normalization of certain immoral behaviors and the promotion of a permissive attitude towards crime can lead to an increase in criminal activity and a decrease in public safety. The liberal agenda often emphasizes individual rights and autonomy over public safety, leading to policies that favor criminals over law-abiding citizens. We saw this during the rise of “peaceful protests” during COVID, protests that were so peaceful they looted and burned down entire sections of cities and resulted in numerous murders and injuries. But hey, you didn’t see that on the evening news. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Another danger of a morally liberal society is the erosion of morality and ethical standards. Traditional conservative values emphasize the importance of a strong moral code and ethical principles as the foundation of a virtuous society, which, let me remind you, is based on the commandments we refer to as the “10 Commandments”, given to the nation of Israel as the revelation of God’s morality. However, the liberal agenda often promotes a relativistic view of morality, where all values and beliefs are considered equally valid, resulting in a society where anything goes. This can lead to a lack of personal responsibility, a breakdown in social norms, and a disregard for the common good. Plus, it’s just ridiculous. Morality by its nature cannot be relative. It has an objective moral standard, and that standard is God. But I‘m getting onto a different soap box, so let me keep going here. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Furthermore, the promotion of sexual promiscuity and pornography will continue to have a negative impact on public health, as well as social and emotional wellbeing. The liberal agenda often promotes sexual liberation and the normalization of immoral behaviors, leading to a society where sexual expression is considered a right rather than a privilege. This can lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Plus, it leads to all the passive males walking around addicted to the sex they see on their cell phones. Passive males are never good for a society. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Moreover, a morally liberal society can be detrimental to education and intellectual development. The liberal agenda often promotes political correctness and the censorship of ideas that are deemed offensive or controversial, resulting in a lack of intellectual diversity and a decrease in the quality of education.  You can’t teach what actually happened in history when the truth offends people, and you can’t promote healthy debate and diversity if ideas when people with individual beliefs get silenced for the sake of creating a safe space for the snowflakes. This can lead to a society that is unable to critically evaluate ideas and think for itself, resulting in a decline in innovation, scientific progress, and cultural development. In other words, you end up with a bunch of morons.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Lastly, a morally liberal society can be detrimental to national security and international relations. The promotion of appeasement and pacifism can lead to a weakening of national defense and a lack of commitment to international security. The leaders of the nation lose their backbones and get walked all over, again, because they don’t want to offend. The liberal agenda often favors diplomacy and negotiation over military strength, leading to a perception of weakness among foreign adversaries and a decrease in national security. It’s no shock the United States is no longer feared among national powers as the rise in liberal policies has made us known more for our transgender ideology than our military superiority. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The dangers of a morally liberal, progressive, and perverse society cannot be overstated. The erosion of traditional conservative values, such as the importance of the family unit, personal responsibility, and the pursuit of individual excellence, can lead to a society that is deeply divided and lacking in purpose. The promotion of a victim culture and collectivist ideologies can result in a lack of economic freedom and personal autonomy, as well as a decrease in innovation and prosperity. Furthermore, the normalization of immoral behaviors and the permissive attitude towards crime can lead to an increase in criminal activity and a decrease in public safety. It is crucial that we preserve and promote traditional conservative values to ensure the stability, prosperity, and safety of our society. This is not only what American society needs, but it is what any society needs. This is what God gave to His people so long ago, and it is what we need to recover in our crumbling society today.</p>
