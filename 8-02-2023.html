                    <h2>Running to Win</h2>
                    
                    <br>
                   

<p>I recently finished “Run to Win: The Lifelong Pursuits of a Godly Man” by Tim Challies on vacation. To be fair, this book isn’t going to knock your socks off. It isn’t going to blow your mind with brand new strategies for how to live the Christian life. In fact, if you’re a seminary-trained pastor, you probably won’t learn a single thing from reading this book. But you should still read it. That’s because every other man in your congregation ought to read this book, because they will benefit from reading it greatly. Therefore, you should read it with them. Yes, the book is that good, and in fact, it’s so good, I’ll give you the spark notes version in this blog post just to incentivize you to read it.

    <br>
    <br> 
    
    The main idea of the book, the central thesis if you will, could be summarized as follows: Believers ought to approach the Christian life as a race (according to Paul’s letter of 1 Corinthians), and in order to win, they need to be single-minded in their pursuit of victory. Half-hearted effort will bring no reward. So, how can Christian men “run to win” in every area of their life?How can they be as committed to winning the Christian life as the greatest athlete is to their sport? Challies breaks the book down into multiple different sections, so I’ll just look at them each in turn. 
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Embrace Your Purpose</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Embracing your purpose is crucial in living the Christian life. It's not a matter of whether you're running the race, but rather, how you are running it. Understanding your purpose is the key to running this race effectively. In Titus 2:11-14, it is evident that God saves and sanctifies believers for a specific reason – to do good to others and bring glory to Him. When you experience the transformation brought about by Jesus Christ, your life gains a new purpose. Challies advises you to focus on laying up treasure in heaven, spending ample time with God, and leading others to Christ. For further guidance on optimizing your life and achieving your purpose, consider reading "Do More Better" by Tim Challies.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Renew Your Mind</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Renewing your mind is a critical aspect of the Christian life, as emphasized in Romans 12:2. As a Christian, you face two options – conforming to the world's values or undergoing transformation through Christ. To be successful in your journey and run to win, it is essential to renew your mind. Sin not only caused you to walk in darkness but also clouded your understanding. John Wesley's hymn "And Can It Be" likely serves as a reminder of God's transformative power in our lives. The world represents any belief system that opposes God and contradicts the teachings of the Bible. To experience true renewal, the Spirit of God must work through the Word of God. Take a moment to reflect on where you invest most of your time – in conformity or transformation? Transformed lives start with transformed minds. To achieve this renewal, it is crucial to eliminate any temptations or influences that lead to conformity. Instead, focus on replacing the old ways with new, God-honoring practices and thoughts. By doing so, you will align yourself with God's purpose and experience the profound impact of a renewed mind in your Christian walk.
    
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Know Your Doctrine</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Understanding and knowing doctrine is fundamental to the Christian faith. It goes beyond mere belief; it is about being equipped to safeguard the gospel's deposit. In this journey, two types of doctrine exist – sound doctrine that aligns with biblical truth and false doctrine that misrepresents it. Faithful living for God is inseparable from having a right knowledge of God. Aspire to be a theologian, for every Christian man should seek to deepen their understanding of God's truth. By knowing how Christ loved, we can learn to love like Him, and in turn, teach others, including our children. To enhance your knowledge of doctrine and theology, consider studying the works of renowned authors like John Stott's "Basic Christianity," JI Packer's "Knowing God," Michael Horton's "Poor Christianity," Wayne Grudem's "Systematic Theology," and John MacArthur's "Biblical Doctrine." Additionally, Ligonier's Connect platform provides valuable video resources for further learning. Through continuous study and learning, you can grow in your faith, strengthen your doctrinal foundation, and live a life that faithfully represents Christ's teachings.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Practice Your Devotion</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Character is not just about who you appear to be in front of others; it is equally significant in private when no one is looking. Reflect on yourself and ask whether you are weak and distant in your private worship. Communication with God is essential, and it reveals our commitment to our faith. The Bible emphasizes the importance of prayer and spending time reading the Word for every Christian. To strengthen your character and grow in your faith, prioritize private devotion. Develop a plan to make this a regular part of your life. Organize your prayers and consider using tools like the Prayermate App to help you stay focused and consistent. Opt for shorter, more frequent sessions, as they can be more manageable and impactful. By making private worship a priority and establishing a structured approach, you will nurture your character and deepen your relationship with God, both in public and private spheres of your life.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Prioritize Your Church</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Prioritizing your church is crucial for pursuing spiritual fitness. God's plan for the world is often fulfilled through the local church, making it a natural context for growth and service. To run the race of faith effectively, you require the support and encouragement of your local church community. Active involvement in your local church is essential. By serving and being an active member, you contribute to the well-being of the community and strengthen your own faith. While good intentions can initiate your journey, it is conviction and consistent habits that will help you finish well in your faith. Start by finding a good church that aligns with your beliefs and values. Once you have found the right fit, fully commit to being a part of it. The book of Hebrews emphasizes the importance of not neglecting to meet together, underlining the significance of regular attendance and involvement in the life of the church. By prioritizing your church, you not only enhance your spiritual growth but also play a role in fulfilling God's purposes on earth through His local body of believers. Engaging with the local church provides a firm foundation and a supportive community as you continue your journey of faith and strive to live a purposeful, Christ-centered life.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Maintain Your Vigilance</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    To achieve victory in our faith journey, maintaining vigilance is essential all the way to the finish line. Be aware of where your enemies are most likely to attack and be prepared to stand firm. Exercise vigilance against the world, the flesh, and the devil, as they are constant threats to your spiritual well-being. Prayer plays a vital role in maintaining your vigilance. Stay committed to consistent and fervent prayer, seeking God's guidance and strength. Additionally, utilize the ordinary means of grace, such as reading the Bible, participating in worship, and engaging in fellowship, to reinforce your spiritual defenses. Just as a diligent soldier remains vigilant when facing the enemy, do not neglect your spiritual duty. Know your areas of temptation and stay on guard against them. Prioritize the Lord's Supper as a means of drawing closer to God and remembering the sacrifice of Christ, which empowers and sustains you in your vigilance. Remember, prayer is a powerful weapon against the forces that seek to weaken your faith. So, pray diligently, be prepared for the battles ahead, and maintain your vigilance through the ordinary means of grace, relying on God's strength and guidance to overcome any challenges that come your way.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Redeem Your Time</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    The passing of time is a profound reality, and wasting it is tragic. If people treated their money as carelessly as they do their time, it would be considered insanity. Therefore, it becomes imperative to redeem time from futile pursuits and dedicate it to noble causes. While you cannot add more time to your life, you have the power to use the time you have wisely. Assess how you might be wasting time through laziness, excessive focus on business without diligence, spiritual carelessness, or even neglecting the necessity of rest. To redeem your time, free yourself from lesser pursuits and prioritize the most significant ones. Identify the essential aspects of life that deserve your time and attention, such as personal growth, meaningful relationships, serving others, and spiritual development. By doing so, you can maximize the impact of your time, align it with God's purposes, and live a life that truly matters. Remember, time is a precious gift, and redeeming it means using it purposefully to make a positive difference in your own life and in the lives of others.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    <strong>Act Your Age</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Acting your age goes beyond growing old; it involves growing up and maturing spiritually. A life filled with childish behavior is unlikely to exhibit the depth of spiritual maturity needed for a Christian man. Instead, the goal should be steady, life-long progress in your faith. As a Christian man, you have a responsibility before God to act your age and be prepared for the next stages of life. Cultivate self-control, as it is a crucial aspect of maturing spiritually and resisting the allure of immaturity. Consider what responsibilities should align with your age, and seek to fulfill them with diligence and integrity. Take a close look at your passions and hobbies, ensuring they contribute positively to your growth and maturity. Immaturity becomes evident when undue time and resources are invested in lesser pursuits that hinder your spiritual progress. The true test of maturity lies in how you respond to criticism. A mature individual welcomes constructive criticism and learns from it, while an immature one may become defensive or resistant. Embrace feedback as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Pursue Your Vocation</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Pursuing your vocation is an integral part of being human, as we were created to work. Discipline yourself to diligently pursue your work, even though sin has made it more challenging and less fulfilling. Nevertheless, as Christians, we are called to obey God's creation mandate to work and exercise dominion over His creation. Your work serves multiple purposes: it provides for your needs and the needs of others, enables you to serve those around you, and allows God to distribute His gifts to the world through your vocation. Therefore, approach your work with dedication and a strong work ethic, avoiding idleness and striving to be a diligent steward of the opportunities and talents God has given you. Remember that all work, regardless of its nature or status, can be equally dignified if done to the glory of God. Through your vocation, you can bring honor to Him and make a positive impact on the world. While pursuing your career, also begin planning for life beyond it. Consider how you can transition gracefully into new phases of life, remaining faithful to God's calling even as your vocation changes. By embracing your vocation as a means to serve and honor God, you can find fulfillment in your work and purposefully contribute to His kingdom in all stages of life.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    
    <strong>Master Your Finances</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Mastering your finances is essential, as money can bring both joy and burden to your life. Recognize that everything in the world belongs to the Lord, and you are merely a steward of these resources. Therefore, handle money with careful consideration, knowing that it has the potential to hold you captive if mismanaged. Money can be a wonderful servant when used wisely, but a terrible master when it controls your decisions and priorities. To gain a better understanding of managing finances, consider reading a book like "Managing God's Money" by Randy Alcorn. Create a budget to account for every penny of your income. By doing so, you gain control over your spending and make intentional choices that align with your financial goals and values. While it's essential to be responsible with your finances, it's also okay to enjoy your money and the blessings it provides. However, plan your giving as well. Be generous in supporting causes that align with your values and contribute to the well-being of others. John Wesley's four questions on money spending offer valuable guidance. Ask yourself: "In spending this money, am I acting like a steward of God?" "Am I giving to those in need?" "Am I avoiding debt?" "Am I saving for the future?"
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Guard Your Health</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Guarding your health is a fundamental responsibility, recognizing that God owns your body as its Creator and Savior. Therefore, present your body as a living sacrifice to honor Him. God expects you to steward, nurture, and surrender your body, using it wisely and purposefully. To maintain good health, plan to be fit through wise and moderate eating habits, as well as engaging in vigorous exercise. Guard against idleness, as a sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues. Avoid gluttony, as the inability to control your desires in this area can impact other aspects of your well-being as you age. Understand that as you age, physical decline is a natural part of life. However, by taking care of your body, you can prepare for this decline and minimize its impact on your overall health and quality of life.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Control Your Sexuality</strong>
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Controlling your sexuality is a vital aspect of living a godly and fulfilling life. In today's world, sexual incontinence prevails, and self-control is lacking. However, the gospel not only saves your soul but also grants you the power of self-control, which leads to what is truly good and satisfying. As a married individual, the sexual expression is to be reserved exclusively for pleasing your spouse. True pleasure lies not in indulging in momentary desires but in obedience to God's design for sexuality. Practicing self-control means refraining from activities such as masturbation, which ultimately stem from self-love and is more akin to homosexuality than heterosexuality. Bouncing your heart, not just your eyes, requires guarding your thoughts and desires to maintain purity in your mind and actions. To support your journey towards sexual purity, seek accountability from trustworthy individuals who can provide guidance and encouragement. Give your all in your pursuit of holiness and obeying God's commands regarding sexuality. If you stumble, remember that seeking forgiveness is an essential part of the Christian walk. God's grace is abundant, and He offers forgiveness and restoration to those who repent. Finally, prioritize your intimate relationship with your spouse within the bounds of marriage. Let your physical passions and affections be fulfilled by your wife, honoring the sacred bond between you and experiencing the fulfillment of God's design for sexuality within the context of marriage. By exercising self-control and seeking God's guidance, you can lead a life that reflects His righteousness and brings glory to Him in every aspect, including your sexuality.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Consider Your Legacy</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Considering your legacy is a crucial aspect of living a purposeful life. What you aim to leave behind when you die shapes how you will live in the present. As a Christian, the best legacy you can leave for your children is a sacred, gospel legacy – one that reflects your unwavering faith in Christ and your commitment to living according to His teachings. The second legacy you can leave is a legacy of godliness. This involves exemplifying a life marked by righteousness, integrity, and devotion to God. By living a life that embodies godliness, you inspire those around you and leave a lasting impact on future generations. As you think about your legacy, consider the values, principles, and beliefs that define your life. Aim to pass on a legacy that reflects your dedication to God and His truth, as this will have a far-reaching and transformative effect on your family, friends, and community. Strive to leave a legacy that points others to Christ and honors His name, making a lasting impact on the world for the glory of God.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Foster Your Friendships</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Fostering meaningful friendships is essential for the well-being of your soul. Genuine friendships provide support, encouragement, and companionship in life's journey, making them vital for your emotional and spiritual growth. Take the time to examine your friendships, as not all connections are beneficial. Evaluate whether your friendships are built on mutual respect, trust, and shared values. Healthy friendships should uplift and inspire you, bringing joy and positivity into your life.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Accept Your Leadership</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Accepting your leadership role as a husband is in line with biblical principles. The Bible assumes that husbands will lead their families, just as Christ leads the church. Therefore, embrace your responsibility to imitate Christ's leadership in your marriage and family life. Character is at the core of effective leadership. Focus on cultivating strong character traits, such as integrity, humility, and selflessness. When you lead with character, other aspects of leadership will naturally fall into place. To be a worthy leader, prioritize devotion to God. Be a man of the Word, regularly immersing yourself in Scripture, and be a man of prayer, seeking God's wisdom and guidance in all aspects of your life and leadership. It is essential to recognize that a husband who dwells in depravity or fails to prioritize devotion is ill-suited to lead effectively. Therefore, continually strive to grow spiritually and be a godly example for your family. As you accept your leadership role, commit yourself to lead in a way that honors Christ and benefits your family. Embrace your responsibility with humility and dedication, knowing that God equips and empowers you to lead with love, grace, and wisdom. By being a Christ-like leader, you create an environment of love and harmony within your family, leading them closer to God and fostering a strong and united household.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Treasure Your Marriage</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Treasuring your marriage is essential for building a strong and fulfilling relationship with your spouse. As a husband, your love for your wife should be characterized by sacrificial, purposeful, nurturing, and steadfast qualities. Sacrificial love means putting your wife's needs and well-being above your own. It involves making selfless choices and being willing to make sacrifices for her happiness and growth. Purposeful love requires intentional effort to actively invest in your marriage. Be deliberate in showing affection, appreciation, and care for your wife. Set meaningful goals together and work as a team to achieve them. Nurturing love involves providing emotional support, encouragement, and understanding to your wife. Be her safe haven, someone she can confide in and rely on in times of joy and struggle. Steadfast love means remaining committed and loyal to your wife, even in the face of challenges and difficulties. Let your love for her be unwavering and steadfast, demonstrating your dedication to your marriage vows. Give your wife a voice in your life by actively listening to her thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Value her perspectives and make decisions together as a team. Exclusivity is essential in a marriage. Prioritize your wife above all others, and maintain clear boundaries with the opposite sex to protect the sanctity of your relationship. Continue to pursue your wife, even after years of marriage. Show her that she is still cherished and loved by committing yourself to her well-being and happiness.
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    <strong>Nurture Your Children</strong>
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Nurturing your children is a vital responsibility as a Christian parent. Ephesians 6:4 and Colossians 3:21 emphasize the importance of parenting with love, discipline, and instruction, all while avoiding provocation or discouragement. The key task of Christian parents is discipleship – raising your children in the ways of the Lord and guiding them to a personal relationship with Christ. Your role as a parent is to instill godly values, teach them the Scriptures, and model a life of faith. Confessing your sin to your children shows them humility and honesty. It helps build trust and teaches them the importance of acknowledging mistakes and seeking forgiveness. Spend quality time with your children, engaging in activities that nurture your bond and create lasting memories. Enjoy the moments shared with them, as parenthood is a gift to be cherished. Parent with confidence, knowing that God has equipped you with everything you need to fulfill your role as a father and husband. Trust in His guidance and rely on His strength as you lead and nurture your children. By providing a loving, nurturing, and disciplined environment, you lay a strong foundation for your children's physical, emotional, and spiritual growth. As a Christian parent, your ultimate goal is to raise children who love and follow God, leaving a lasting legacy of faith for generations to come.

    <br> 
    
    <strong>Conclusion: Finish Strong</strong>
    
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    Finishing strong in your Christian life is of utmost importance. Consider how you will cross the finish line as you take your last step. Remember, there are no prizes for almost crossing the finish line – the race must be completed with endurance and dedication. Approach the last lap of your Christian journey with determination and zeal. Sprint with all your might, going all out until the end. Finish the race of faith with unwavering commitment and perseverance.</p>
