                        This past weekend we celebrated Father’s Day, and I must say it is a holiday that needs to be celebrated. In a world where masculinity is ostracized, sons are taught to reject what it means to be who they were created to be, and women are in desperate need of godly men to lead them, we find ourselves in a manhood problem and thus in a father problem. I am so grateful to have had a wonderful father figure my entire life to look up to, a man who I have a deep admiration for and have an incredibly close relationship. It is to this man, my father, that the blog is dedicated to. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Growing up, there were many sayings my father said that stuck with me through it all. “Perception is reality.” “I’d rather be happy than right.” “We don’t hate, we strongly dislike.” And my personal favorite, after cooking an excellent meal and shielding himself from the coming praise for how delicious it was, we would typically receive, “it was something different.” All these years, and these sayings have stuck with me and even helped form thoughts and actions as an adult. This is because words have a powerful influence on us, and even more so the words of a parent, one whom we look up to and admire. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Another string of words that lives rent free in my head are the lyrics to an old folk song by Harry Chapin, titled “Cat’s in the Cradle.” The song tells the powerful story of a father's gradual realization of his neglectful approach to parenting and its eventual consequences. The lyrics serve as a poignant reminder of the vital role fathers play in their children's lives and the importance of actively modeling positive behaviors and values. This article, I plan to dive into the lyrics of the song to emphasize the significance of fathers' influence and their responsibility to shape their sons' future parenting and life choices.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The song's narrative unfolds through a series of vignettes, spanning the lifespan of a father and his son. The father's initial absence due to work commitments and the pursuit of material success sets the tone for the story. His son, yearning for his father's presence and seeking to emulate him, repeatedly expresses his desire to be like his dad. However, the father consistently fails to prioritize his son's needs, responding with promises of future quality time together.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The song's chorus, "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Little boy blue and the man in the moon, 'When you coming home, dad?' 'I don't know when, But we'll get together then, You know we'll have a good time then,'" highlights the recurring pattern of the father's absence and postponed bonding. This pattern resonates with many fathers who find themselves caught in the cycle of work and obligations, neglecting the crucial connections and relationships in their lives. Sadly, these are connections and relationships that can rarely, if ever, be repaired. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        It would be impossible to overemphasize the significance of fathers as role models for their children, especially their sons. The song illustrates the father's failure to model the values and priorities he would wish for his son. By choosing work over quality time with his son, he inadvertently teaches his son that success and material pursuits take precedence over nurturing relationships and the family he left at home. This absence of a fatherly presence leaves a void in the son's life, ultimately shaping his own approach to parenting and decision-making later on.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        And we know that science has affirmed this tune as well. Research consistently demonstrates that children who have involved and present fathers benefit from improved cognitive, emotional, and social development. Fathers who actively engage in their children's lives contribute to higher academic achievement, enhanced self-esteem, and healthier interpersonal relationships. The song serves as a cautionary tale, reminding fathers of the lasting impact their actions and choices have on their children's futures.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        As the song progresses, the son matures into a replica of his father. The lyrics, "And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me, My boy was just like me," reflect the regretful realization of missed opportunities and the perpetuation of a harmful pattern. You can hear the sting of regret and the passivity of so many years just hitting the father, all at once. The consequences of the father's neglectful behavior manifest in his son's inability to establish a deep connection and find time for his own father. In other words, he had become his father. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        As a commentary on culture, "Cat's in the Cradle" serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of fathers actively modeling positive parenting behaviors and values for their children. Fathers have a profound responsibility to prioritize their presence and invest time in building meaningful relationships with their sons. By doing so, they provide a solid foundation upon which their sons can build their own lives and, in turn, become responsible, nurturing fathers themselves. The song's message resonates across generations, urging fathers to break the cycle of neglect and foster strong, enduring connections with their children, ensuring a brighter future for all.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        As for my own father, the reason I chose a song like this to dedicate to a man like him isn’t too hard to figure out. My father used to play the song on a regular basis for my brother and I, and at the end would simply say “that’s a scary thought, that you can end up like your dad.” Indeed, it is a scary thought, if you have the father in the song. But there is a flipside to the story presented in the song. Just like the son turned into the absent father, so too would the son have turned into a present, engaged, and involved father. The lyrics, "And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me, My boy was just like me," could be incredibly reassuring words to a father who has knowingly poured his life into his children and given them everything they could ever need. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        In my case, this is why the song is such a happy tune for me. When I listen to the song, I don’t get sad or regretful. I think of my father, a man who was involved, who has been there for me my entire life, and who is still there for me. I long for the day when my Dad would think to himself “my boy was just like me,” because it would mean I was a man who gave his family everything, who loved his wife sacrificially, and had his values and his priorities in the right place. It is a scary thought if your father is in the song. But what a joyous thought if your father is different. Happy Father’s Day, to the incredible man who is my Father and man who I look forward to growing up like one day.</p>
