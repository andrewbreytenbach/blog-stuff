                    Hallelujah, He Will Hold Me Fast

                    <p>There are some things in life that hit the right spot, and the words we try and use to describe
                        it don’t do them justice. Words will never be able to encapsulate exactly how I feel when I wake
                        up in the morning and get a piping hot cup of coffee in my hands and take that first sip. Words
                        will never be able to describe the feeling of enjoying a hotdog and a fine pilsner on a Sunday
                        afternoon watching America’s pastime. And words will never be able to perfectly describe the
                        feeling when your head hits the pillow after a long day of work and you’re exhausted and ready
                        for bed. Words will never do those moments justice because they are just right what you needed
                        in that particular moment.</p>

                    <p>”Never Perish” by Bishop J.C. Ryle is something else I would throw into this category. "Never
                        Perish" is a powerful treatise that Bishop J.C. Ryle wrote to expound on the doctrine of
                        perseverance of the saints. This doctrine is founded upon the biblical teachings that those who
                        have been truly regenerated by the Holy Spirit will continue in faith and holiness until the end
                        of their lives and be glorified one day with Christ. In this post, my aim is to give you some of
                        what Ryle gave to me in his work. I hope to start your week off on a note of encouragement, on
                        just the right note. As believers, we ought to feel this when we meditate on such a doctrine.
                        And I have decided to spare you the plethora of quotes I have highlighted in my copy of the
                        book. If I were to give them all to you, this blog would become a short book. Instead, I leave
                        you with the haymaker at the end.</p>

                    <h4>What Does the Doctrine of Perseverance Mean?</h4>

                    <p>The doctrine of perseverance, also known as the perseverance of the saints, is the belief that
                        those who have been truly saved and regenerated by the Holy Spirit will continue in faith and
                        holiness until the end of their lives and then reign for all of eternity with Christ in the new
                        heaven and the new earth. This doctrine emphasizes the work of God in preserving the believer's
                        faith, rather than the believer's effort to maintain their own faith. It is grounded in the
                        assurance that God will complete the work He began in the believer and that the believer's faith
                        will not ultimately fail. This doctrine does not negate the role of personal responsibility but
                        highlights the sovereign grace of God in securing the believer's salvation. It is not the
                        intensity or amount of the believer’s faith which saves them. Rather, it is the object of their
                        faith– the God who predestined them from before the foundation of the world.</p>

                    <h4>The Scriptural Grounds on Which the Doctrine is Built</h4>

                    <p>The doctrine of perseverance is built upon various passages from the Bible. In the book itself,
                        Ryle simply lists forty-four verses he believes speaks clearly on this topic and then moves on.
                        No explanation or exposition. He believes the writings are so clear that any attempt at his to
                        add further clarity would undermine how abundantly clear they speak to the topic at hand. Boy,
                        do we not make men like they used to. Since I am not of the same intellectual brilliance as the
                        Bishop, I will give you a few Scriptural proofs to aid in my discussion. In the Gospel of John,
                        Jesus Christ Himself declares that He will not lose any of those whom the Father has given to
                        Him and that they shall never perish (John 6:39, 10:28). Paul the Apostle emphasizes that
                        nothing can separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:38-39) and that He
                        who began a good work in them will bring it to completion (Philippians 1:6). Other passages that
                        support the doctrine include 1 Peter 1:5, which speaks of believers being kept by the power of
                        God through faith, and Hebrews 7:25, which teaches that Jesus is able to completely save those
                        who come to God through Him. If you want the other thirty-eight texts, you’ll need to pick up
                        the eBook, available free <a href="https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/ryle/Never%20Perish!%20-%20J.%20C.%20Ryle.pdf">here.</a>

                    <h4>Reasons Why Many Reject the Doctrine</h4>

                    <p>There are several reasons why many individuals reject the doctrine of perseverance. Some argue
                        that it promotes a sense of complacency and discourages personal growth and sanctification.
                        Others believe that it undermines the warnings and exhortations found in Scripture, which seem
                        to imply that believers can fall away from the faith. Still, others reject the doctrine due to a
                        belief in the doctrine of apostasy, which teaches that true believers can abandon their faith
                        and lose their salvation. However, the most prominent reason Ryle argues for, and the one I
                        think holds the most weight, is the lack of doctrinal knowledge among believers today.
                        Christians do not have any sort of doctrinal knowledge, and so it logically follows they cannot
                        be expected to grasp this weighty, core doctrine of the gospel if the rest of their theological
                        knowledge is weak and frail. In order to correct this, a return to studying the Scriptures and
                        knowing God is needed.</p>

                    <h4>Why the Doctrine is of Great Practical Importance</h4>

                    <p>I firmly believe that the doctrine of perseverance is of great practical importance for several
                        reasons. Firstly, it provides believers with a solid foundation for assurance of their
                        salvation, knowing that God will not abandon the work He began in them. This assurance fosters a
                        sense of peace and confidence in the believer's relationship with God. Secondly, it encourages
                        believers to rely on God's grace and power in their pursuit of holiness, rather than depending
                        solely on their own efforts. This fights the inward desire to turn to legalism to please God.
                        Thirdly, it demonstrates the faithfulness and reliability of God, who remains committed to His
                        children's spiritual well-being even amidst trials and difficulties. Lastly, the doctrine of
                        perseverance underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which produces genuine and
                        lasting change in the lives of believers. This is a powerful doctrine which believers must cling
                        to, as I truly believe it is essential to a right knowledge of the gospel.</p>

                    <p>To close, I can do no better than offer the words of Ryle himself. I hope they strike a chord
                        within you, and the Lord brings your heart joy as a result:</p>

                    <p><em>“But what is the best antidote against the believer's fears and anxieties? What is most
                            likely to cheer him as he looks forward to the untried future and remembers the weary past?
                            I answer without hesitation, the doctrine of the final perseverance of God's elect.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Let him know that God having begun a good work in him will never allow it to be overthrown.
                            Let him know that the footsteps of Christ's little flock are all in one direction. They have
                            erred. They have been vexed. They have been tempted. But not one of them has been lost. Let
                            him know that those whom Jesus loves, He loves unto the end. Let him know that He will not
                            suffer the weakest lamb in His flock to perish in the wilderness, or the tenderest flower in
                            His garden to wither and die. Let him know that Daniel in the den of lions, the three
                            children in a fiery furnace, Paul in the shipwreck, Noah in the ark, were none of them more
                            cared for and more secure than the believer in Christ. Let him know that he is fenced,
                            walled, protected, guarded by the Almighty power of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and cannot
                            perish. Let him know that it is not in the power of the things in the present or things to
                            come,—of men or of devils,—of cares within or troubles without, to separate one single child
                            of God from the love that is in Christ Jesus.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is a strong consolation. These are the things which God has laid up in the Gospel for
                            the establishment and confirmation of His people. Well would it be for His people if these
                            things were more brought forward than they are in the Church of Christ. Verily I believe
                            that one reason of the saints' weakness is their ignorance of the truths which God has
                            revealed in order to make them strong.”</em></p>
