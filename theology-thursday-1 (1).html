            <h2>Theology Thursday #1- Why We Need to Know God</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Thus far, my journey as a writer and blogger has been unimpressive, and while I don’t expect this to change, I want to begin a new staple for what you, as the reader, might expect every single Thursday I post a blog. Let’s call it something unique and bold, inspiring and provocative. Let’s call it: Theology Thursdays. Now while the title might not be something that makes you want to jump out of our seat and beat your chest, it is what every Thursday will hold for us going forward, so let me explain in this series premiere if you will WHY I want to make this a weekly staple of the reader’s diet. </p>
            <p>We need to have a robust, God-exalting theology as followers of Jesus. We need to have a high view of God, a view of God that reflects what the Bible says and teaches about Him, and a view of God that reflects to an unbelieving world that the God we worship is the one true God worthy of all praise.</p>
            <p>A.W. Tozer has famously said that the most important thing about us is what comes into our minds when we think about God. A high view of God leads to high worship, praise, and adoration. A low view of God leads to shallow worship and shallow praise of our Savior. It robs God of glory that is rightly his. </p>
            <p>Here is the big idea not just for today, but for every future Theology Thursday blog post: Our greatest need is to know who God is. We need to have a Big-God Theology. It is my hope that through this endeavor, each of us will have a deep desire to grow in our relationship with God, that each of us will have a higher view of God, a greater understanding of His attributes, and deeper praise and worship for this great big God. </p>
         
            <h3>So, why do we need to know God?</h3>
            
            <p>I have already said that the most important thing about us is what comes to our minds when we think about God. But let’s be honest, there are plenty of important things that we don’t devote any time to knowing. For example, the gravitational pull of the universe is very important. If something were to go wrong with it, every single one of us would die. But most of us go our entire lives without ever trying to learn anything about it. Or take the human body for example. Most of us who don’t work in the medical field don’t know the first thing about how any of the major organ systems in our body work. And we don’t have to, since their function is independent of our knowledge of them. We can continue to rely on our heart to pump blood whether or not we understand how each contraction works. And that’s all fine and dandy, but theology is different. Our knowledge of God is different. Everything in human existence flows from theology. All of our existence comes from the fountain of the Godhead. It goes without saying, then, this God must be known in order for human life to be meaningful and to have purpose. But hey, if you don’t want to believe me, listen to John Calvin, the theologian par excellence of the Reformation and the greatest mind in the history of the church, who said “Wisdom is not simply self-knowledge, but that knowledge, true knowledge of the self, comes via the knowledge of God.”</p>
            <p>We need to devote time to knowing who God is, because it is directly tied to our relationship with him. We cannot be in a real, intimate relationship with a God we do not know. So let me give you 10 reasons why you need to know God, and then in future Thursday posts, we’ll get into what knowledge of God looks like.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><u>Practical problems have theological answers.</u>
                If there is one thing you take away from this blog series, I want this to be it! All theology should lead to real life application because theological knowledge that doesn’t change our lives is worthless. Most of the opposition to theology that Christians have about it being boring, abstract, irrelevant, and separate from reality stem from the fact that too often people study about God, learn about God, and attempt to know God more without connecting it to how it should impact their day to day lives.</p>
                <p>That should never be the case! All doctrine should lead to devotion. All orthodoxy should lead to orthopraxy. Or said another way, what we know to be true about God and his nature and his being should directly impact how we live our lives. There should be no ivory tower theologians who are talking about things that have no impact on their everyday livelihood. All good theology, all right study of God, will have a direct impact on how we live our lives. And I would take this a step further by claiming that any knowledge of God that doesn’t lead to a change in the way you live your life is not true knowledge of God.</p></li>
                
                <li><p><u>People need their best theology in their darkest moments. </u>This flows directly from what we just said about theology having real life implications. When you are going through a season of suffering in your life, a difficult moment, what do you want to be told?
                </p>
                <p>“I know this is hard right now, but God isn't in control of what’s happening in your life so the best we can do is hope that luck and fate are on your side and maybe this situation will get better soon.”</p>
                <p>OR… “I know this is hard right now. I know the pain is real and every part of you wants to cry out that this isn’t fair. Even when it’s painful, we can know God is completely sovereign over this circumstance. This current situation didn’t catch him by surprise. He is using it right now for both your own good and his own glory. So even though your pain may not go away completely, you can know that no matter how bad it gets, no matter how difficult it becomes, the truth that God is sovereign can comfort you in this pain.”</p>
                <p>You tell me, which one is more comforting? Which one is more assuring? Exactly. It’s also the one that is biblically accurate and correct. In dark times good theology, right knowledge of God, is comforting.</p></li>
                
                 <li><p><u>If you do not have theology, it doesn't mean you won’t have any ideas about God, it just means that you will have a lot of wrong ones. </u>We could be here all day going around the room talking about some of the weird and wacky beliefs a lot of people, and Christians unfortunately, have about God. Any of these ring a bell?
                </p>
                <p>The God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament.</p>
                <p>Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Mormons, all of us serve the same God. </p>
                <p>God helps those people who help themselves. </p>
                <p>God just wants you to be happy. </p>
                <p>God would never give you more than you can handle. </p>
                <p>I could keep going, but you get the point. All of those are statements, appeals to what people believe to be true about God. And yet all of them are wrong. So even when people are trying to avoid theology, right, (I don’t need theology, I just need Jesus), they are actually making theological statements. Everytime we talk about God, we make theological statements. Even atheists make theological statements; saying that God doesn’t exist is still a form of theology (pretty ironic, huh?). No Christian can avoid theology because every Christian is a theologian. As the good Dr. Sproul said, “the issue for us is not whether or not we will be theologians, but whether we are going to be good theologians or bad ones.”</p></li>
                
                  <li><p><u>Nothing can be rightly known if God is not known. </u>God is the creator of the universe. He is the author and originator of everything that exists. All truth is God’s truth, and all truth is derived from the truth of God’s nature and being.
                </p>
                <p>Since knowledge of God is properly basic and necessary for all other truths: ethics, laws, morality, etc., then we need to know about God’s character in order to know what else is right. It is the foundation for every other study we undertake. I’ve heard it said like this: every -ology is a branch of the-ology. Science, math, history, all of them derive from the fact that God has given us brains to use, laws to live by, and created a universe according to these scientific standards that allow us to live in it and study it.  </p></li>
                
                  <li><p><u>We may have knowledge of God without being saved, but we can never be saved without knowledge of God. </u>
                </p>It should go without saying that you can know all the right things about God. You can know all the verses, all the attributes, all the commandments, and yet you can still miss the whole point, which is found in the gospel. That’s what the Pharisees did, remember?
                <p>But it should also be noted that unless you know the truths of God revealed in the Bible, about his love and his grace and the salvation he offers freely through Jesus Christ, you can never be saved. Knowledge of God is essential for salvation. </p></li>
                
                  <li><p><u>Your view of God is the benchmark of your spiritual maturity. </u>John Macarthur, that lion of faithfulness and zealout for the truth of Scripture, says that at the end of the day, your faith rests in your reality of who God is. Therefore, a shallow view of God, a small view of the power of God, a limited view of the grace of God, etc. all contribute to a shrunken faith and ultimately a lack of trust in God. 
                </p>
                <p>And the flipside is also true. A high view of the grace of God, an abundant view of his power, all lead to a large view of his love, a strong faith, and a strong trust in who God is. Our faith needs to rest in a strong and powerful God. 
</p></li>
                
                  <li><p><u>The heart cannot love what the mind does not know. </u>That’s probably going to be the only time I ever quote Jen Wilken on this blog, because I think the quote is phenomenal. Imagine, for a moment, that you’re married. And your spouse has red hair and green eyes. And for your anniversary, you write your spouse a love song. But in the love song, you’re talking about how much you love her blonde hair and her blue eyes. It would be completely fair for your spouse, when they heard this song, to be not only upset, but to think you aren’t even talking about them! And it would be right for your spouse to think that because your love and your affections are obviously misguided. True love and affections need to be informed by truth, by facts.
                </p>
                <p>The same is true of our worship of God. It doesn’t matter how much we say we love God. If our worship and love for God is based on a God who looks like us and talks like us, we will quickly discover our worship is not based on the God of the Bible. This is why it is so important to know who God is. Because we cannot rightly worship God for who He is until we know who He is. 
</p></li>
                
                 <li><p><u>A high view of God leads to high worship of God. </u>This is what we see all throughout the biblical story. People who loved God and who had the highest amount of praise and worship for God knew who He was. They didn’t understand all the fine-workings of doctrine and systematic theology, but they knew who God was. Think of Moses and the burning bush… Think of Abraham being willing to sacrifice Isaac… think of Isaiah chapter 6 when he says “Woe is me!” We need to have a high view of God so that we can appropriately worship God. 

                </p>
                <p>Continue along the same logic of the marriage analogy. The more you know your spouse, the more you are able to love them. That's why people say they love their spouse more after 50 years of marriage than they did on their wedding day. Their knowledge of them grew and so did their love. Knowledge leads to increased love, and increased love leads to a desire for more knowledge of the other. It is a wheel that keeps on turning. In the same way, our knowledge of God will grow and increase our love for God. 
</p></li>
                
                  <li><p><u>The greatest need in the church today is for people to have a sense of the presence of God. </u>Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones said this back in the early 20th century when he wrote his famous book Preachers and Preaching, but the statement is just as relevant, if not more relevant, today. The awareness of the presence of God is absent in the lives of most Christians and by extension most of our churches today. What people most desperately need is a sense of the presence of God. All preaching, all teaching, all study, all worship, should leave us enamored with how great and how majestic the God we worship is.
                </p>
                </li>
                
                <li><p><u>It helps us be more deliberate and careful in our thoughts and speech about God. </u>Simply put, knowledge of God transforms us by the renewing of our minds. We need to be intentional not just in how we talk about God, but how we think about God. We do not want to think wrong thoughts of God or low thoughts about God that rob him of glory or are not in line with his character. The way we act towards and talk about God flows out of our thoughts about Him. The only way we can guard our thoughts about God is to develop our theology of God. I can rattle off many people from the Bible who thought they were thinking about God or relating to God the right way, but it was on their terms, not on God’s terms (think Aaron’s two sons who got incinerated for offering strange fire). We go to God on his terms, according to who He is. That’s why we study theology.
