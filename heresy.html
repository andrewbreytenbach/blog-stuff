            <h2>Same Old, Same Old</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p>I believe in the inerrancy and sufficiency of Scripture. As such, I believe wholeheartedly in the truth and veracity of Ecclesiastes 1:9 “What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.” That’s right… there’s nothing new under the sun. Nothing. It might look different, it might sound different, it might act different, but there is nothing unique or unoriginal in the world.</p>
            <p>While I believe that to be true of all things in general, I believe it to be particularly true when it comes to the subject of heresies. A heresy is a belief or opinion contrary to orthodox Christian doctrine. Heresies have been a recurrent issue throughout the history of the Church, and understanding them is crucial for maintaining sound doctrine and Christian unity. In this blog post, I want to guide you through a brief overview of some of the main heresies and their key proponents both in the history of the church and modernity. </p>
            
            <h4>Judaizers</h4>
            <p>First up on the list of ancient heresies we have the Judaizers, and they’re so ancient that you can actually read about them in your Bible. In fact, the entire book of Galatians was Paul’s hot response to this false teaching. The primary error of this first century heresy was that it attacked the biblical view of justification by grace alone. In short, it denied the gospel. The Judaizers added works as a necessary component to grace as a means of obtaining salvation. So, historically, their biggest proponents were legalistic Jews in the early church (there weren’t a lot of Gentiles running around wanting to get circumcised into adulthood). What might surprise you, however, is seeing how this heresy has changed forms and reappeared today. Due to the main error of its legalistic nature, we can see how today both 7th Day Adventists and Roman Catholics are guilty of this error. </p>
            <p>All three groups share a common tendency to rely on works-based salvation rather than faith alone. The Judaizers emphasized the importance of adhering to Jewish customs and law in addition to faith in Jesus Christ. Similarly, Seventh Day Adventists place a heavy emphasis on keeping the Sabbath and other Old Testament laws. Roman Catholics, meanwhile, have historically placed great emphasis on performing good works and participating in sacraments in order to earn salvation. All of these groups have strayed from the biblical doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. While there are certainly differences between the three groups, they all share a common danger of placing too much emphasis on human effort and not enough on the saving work of Christ. Consider this heresy modernized! </p>
            
            <h4>Gnosticism</h4>
            <p>Next up we have gnosticism. Gnosticism was a heresy that originated in the 2nd century and encompassed a wide range of beliefs. The main tenets of Gnosticism included a dualistic view of reality, with a distinction between the spiritual realm and the material world, and the belief that salvation could be achieved through secret knowledge (gnosis). Gnosticism also denied the goodness of the material world and the incarnation of Jesus Christ (they attacked the humanity of Christ). Early Church Fathers, such as Irenaeus and Tertullian, wrote extensively against Gnostic teachings. Due to its nature of combining mysticism and pagan teachings with Christianity, its most relevant modern counterpart is Mormonism (or really any New Age religion, but let’s focus on the people following Mr. Smith). </p>
            <p>What are the similarities? Both Gnosticism and Mormonism can be viewed as syncretistic religions that draw on multiple sources and teachings, including Christian scripture and tradition, but also other sources of revelation and mystical experience. Both Gnosticism and Mormonism emphasize a special knowledge or insight that is necessary for salvation. In Gnosticism, this knowledge is said to come through divine revelation or mystical experience, while in Mormonism, it is said to come through the teachings of the Book of Mormon and modern-day prophets (seems legit, right?). Furthermore, both Gnosticism and Mormonism have been rightly criticized by Christians for introducing new, non-biblical teachings that challenge traditional Christian beliefs, such as the nature of God and the divinity of Jesus Christ. Consider this heresy officially modernized!</p>
            
            <h4>Arianism</h4>
            <p>Arianism was a heresy that emerged in the 4th century, named after its main proponent, Arius. It taught that Jesus Christ was a created being, inferior to God the Father. The main issue was their denial of the deity of Christ and the denial of the Trinity (come on Patrick!). Arianism caused a major controversy in the early Church, leading to the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, which declared Arianism a heresy and affirmed the doctrine of the Trinity. Due to the anti-Trinitarianism and denial of the deity of Christ, Jehovah’s Witnesses seem to be the best modern counterpart. </p>
            <p>Both Arianism and Jehovah's Witnesses deny the traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity, believing instead that Jesus Christ is a created being and not co-eternal with God the Father. In Arianism, Jesus is seen as a subordinate, lesser divine being, while in Jehovah's Witnesses, Jesus is seen as the first and greatest creation of God. Arianism tended to view Jesus as a divine being with a physical body, while Jehovah's Witnesses emphasize Jesus' physical resurrection but do not hold to a belief in a physical resurrection for everyone. Here’s the major takeaway– anytime Jesus is no longer God, or the Trinity is no longer affirmed, we’ve left orthodoxy and entered heretical territory. This heresy has been modernized!</p>
            
            <h4>Pelagianism</h4>
            <p>Pelagianism, named after its founder Pelagius, was another heresy that emerged in the early 5th century. It denied the doctrine of original sin, asserting that humans are born morally neutral and can choose to do good or evil. Pelagianism also taught that humans can achieve salvation through their own efforts, without the need for divine grace. Thus, this heresy attacked the primacy and sufficiency of God’s grace in salvation. This heresy was condemned at the Council of Carthage in 418 AD. Due to its man-centered nature, the American revivalist Charles Finney (and we could probably throw in a lot of American churches) fall best in this modern re-emergence. </p>
            <p>Pelagianism and the teachings of Charles Finney and his followers share some similarities in their theological emphasis on human ability and free will in salvation. Pelagianism teaches that humanity can achieve salvation through their own effort and moral goodness, without any need for divine grace or intervention. Similarly, Charles Finney and his followers emphasized the role of human will and moral effort in the process of salvation. They believed that through moral persuasion, individuals could be brought to a decision to follow Christ, and that this decision was entirely within their own power (thus denying God’s grace, and the biblical teaching on salvation). Both Pelagianism and Finneyism can be seen as forms of theological liberalism, emphasizing the capacity of human beings to choose their own destiny, rather than relying solely on divine grace. Finneyism is very subtly taught today in many churches, so this one is much more prevalent in so-called Christian circles. This heresy has been modernized!
</p>
            
            <h4>Socinianism</h4>
            <p>The final heresy we will look at today is the heresy of Socinianism. Socinianism originated in the 16th century and was based on an attack on both the doctrine of salvation and the doctrine of Christ. The essential nature of this heresy is rationalism– thus, it is a combination of the worst of all the heresies. Due to its ugly, multi-faceted nature, this heresy is seen in many groups today, among them Open Theists, Theological Liberals, and Unitarians. </p>
            <p>All four groups emphasize the role of human reason and critical inquiry in theological interpretation, and are skeptical of traditional dogmatic formulations. They also tend to place a greater emphasis on the ethical and social dimensions of Christianity, as opposed to the metaphysical and supernatural. Socinians, like theological liberals and Unitarians, also tend to deny traditional doctrines such as the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ, and view these beliefs as unscriptural and irrational. Open theists, like Socinians, reject the notion of divine determinism and believe in a more open and dynamic conception of God's interaction with the world. Even this mutt of a heresy is modernized!</p>
            
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Understanding the history of heresy is vital for Christians as it allows us to better grasp the core doctrines of our faith and recognize deviations from biblical truth. Yes, this blog post covered a lot of information, but you don’t have to memorize all of it today. Let this be a starting point for your own journey into learning more about the history of heresy in the church. That way, the next time you hear that knock on your door Saturday morning, you’ll be ready to rumble. </p>
