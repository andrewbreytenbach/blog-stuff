                    <p>Yes, this is my second blog post directed directly at the actions of former president Donald Trump. No, I’m not a liberal, but these issues need to be addressed and unfortunately the conservatives are just as bad at making excuses as many progressives are. Plus, if President Biden ever gets indicted, I promise I’ll do the same thing, okay?

                        The subject of whether persons should obey the rules of the countries in which they live remains of utmost relevance in today's world, when societal values and conventions appear to be changing on a regular basis. As Christians, it is vital that we turn to the Bible's timeless wisdom to help us understand how to behave toward the political establishment. In this post, we will examine the biblical commandments and examine why abiding by the rules of our country not only benefits the general welfare but also glorifies God. In other words, we will see why this form of obedience is non-negotiable.

                        <strong>
                        
                        The Divine Authority of Government:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Bible develops the idea of divine authority in government and emphasizes that God Himself ultimately appoints all governing authorities. Paul, the apostle, says in Romans 13:1, "Let everyone be submissive to the governing authorities." Since God alone is the source of all authority, God alone has established the ones that already exist. This profound fact makes clear that by abiding by the rules of our country, we recognize and value the authority that God has given to our government.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                        
                        Promoting Order and Justice:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Bible's commandments repeatedly stress the significance of preserving law and justice in society. "You shall not murder," says Exodus 20:13, expressing God's desire to protect life. We support the preservation of human life and the establishment of justice by abiding by the laws against murder. Similar to this, God's goal for a just and ordered community is reflected in the commandments prohibiting stealing, giving false testimony, and adultery. Thus, as Christians, we must obey these laws as a means of preserving order and justice in the societies we live in.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                        
                        A Witness to the World:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        As citizens, we have the power to influence others and demonstrate our faith via our deeds. In Matthew 5:16, Jesus offers His followers direction, saying, "Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." We show our dedication to integrity, honesty, and respect for authority when we abide by the laws of our country. Our faithfulness becomes a potent witness to the Gospel's capacity for transformation.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                        
                        Contributing to the Common Good:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Respecting the rules of our country not only honors God but also serves to advance the welfare of all. Romans 13:3-4 highlights the role of government in maintaining peace and order: "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good." By upholding the law, we support society's health and provide a peaceful atmosphere for all. It’s why we value the laws of our society. We don’t want people breaking laws as they see fit and being above the law. We want people to obey the laws so that collectively as a society we all might benefit from it. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>
                        
                        Submission to Authority:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Bible's command to submit to authority is one of its core ideas. In 1 Peter 2:13–14, Christians are urged to "be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil, and to praise those who do good." And that was written during a time when persecution was rampant. So we as believers today have no excuse not to submit to our governing authorities, regardless of who you are. Yes, that means even a former president. We exhibit our allegiance to God's precepts and foster a spirit of respect and humility by abiding by the rules of our country.

                        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Bible gives explicit instructions on the significance of abiding by the laws of the nations in which we reside. We glorify God by acknowledging the divine authority of government, advancing justice and order, bearing witness to the world, advancing the common good, and modeling submission to authority. In order to represent God's character to a world in need of His grace and truth, let us as Christians work to live in accordance with the laws of our country.</p>
