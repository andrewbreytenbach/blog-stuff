            <h2>Theology Thursday #4</h2>
            <br>
         
   <p>This week’s blog is a continuation of last week’s discussion of God’s sovereignty. If you haven’t read that one already, be sure to do so before reading on here. I’m simply going to pick up right where we left off in Psalm 89:9.</p>

<h4>God’s sovereignty means He is ruler over all (v. 9-11)</h4>

<p>The first part of being ruler over all means that God is in control over nature.</p>

<p><b>God’s sovereignty means He is in control over nature. (v. 9)</b></p>

<p>“You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them” (Psalm 89:9).</p>

<p>God is sovereign over nature and over all of creation. God has rule, dominion, and authority over everything in creation because he made it. </p>

<p>When this Psalm was written, the sea was the most formidable, unknowable part of their environment, and it still is today. Outer space wasn’t a category in their minds, so the ocean was the great unknown. The sea is widely portrayed in Scripture as something that only God can tame and control (Red Sea, Jordan River, Jonah and the fish, etc.)</p>

<p>The argument then, from the greater to the lesser, is that if God can control the sea; if he can have authority and power over the most unknowable, powerful thing in our world, then he has authority over the rest of creation and nature as well. </p>

<p>Nowhere is this power seen more clearly, God’s authority and sovereignty over creation, than at the end of the book of Job. God uses his immense sovereignty over creation to keep Job in check and remind him that he is just man and that God is God. God berates Job with a relentless assault of questions, challenging him and contending that Job has no grounds at all with which to question the Almighty. </p>

<p>“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world?” (Job 38:4)</p>

<p>“Can you send forth Lightning, so that they may go and say ‘Here we are’?” (Job 38:35). Think about that… lightning asks God where it goes to strike on the earth.</p>

<p>Then, all of chapter 39 deals with God’s rule and knowledge of creatures in the world. It leaves Job speechless. Our God is sovereign over nature. God is sovereign over creation, both nature and the creatures in it. </p>

<p><b>Secondly, God ruling over all means He has reigned throughout history. (v. 10)</b></p>

<p>”You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.” (Psalm 89:10)</p>

<p>After the psalmist gives us a broad example from creation, the sea, he transitions now to give a specific example from history. </p>

<p>Rahab here does not refer to the woman Rahab, the prostitute from the book of Joshua. Rahab is a nickname for Egypt, an enemy of God (Isaiah 51:9; Psalm 87:4). This is so powerful because the victory of the Israelites in Egypt, God’s deliverance of his people in giving them freedom from their bondage to the Egyptians, is central to the Old Testament storyline. It is the gospel of the Old Testament. </p>

<p>And the statement here in this verse is so clear: God decimated his enemies. He destroyed the people who held his chosen nation, the people he loved, Israel, in captivity. That event was the end of their powerful dynasty. And since God did this to Egypt in the Old Testament, how much more did he do this to Satan, evil, and the powers of hell through the cross in the New Testament. God’s physical deliverance in the OT was meant to be a picture of the future spiritual redemption that would come from Jesus delivering us from bondage to sin. It is through Jesus that we have ultimate freedom, true freedom from sin and death.</p>

<p>God has been in control throughout all of history. No nation can subvert or change what God has purposed to take place. There was nothing Egypt or Pharaoh could have done to change this. They were helpless in opposition to the sovereign God. </p>

<p>The authority God holds over history gives believers hope because it means that God also has authority over the future. If the past has been ordered according to his purposes, if the course of history has been shaped by the will of God, then surely God knows and will bring to pass that which he desires in the future. </p>

<p><b>Third, and comprehensively, God’s sovereignty means He presently reigns over all things. (v. 11)</b></p>

<p>“The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them.” (Psalm 89:11)</p>

<p>The meaning here could not be more clear– God is sovereign over heaven. God is sovereign over the earth. And God is sovereign over everything on the earth. All things are in subjection to God. This is what it means to say that God reigns. That God is King, and everything that is created in the universe is his kingdom. God is seated on the throne, ruling from on high. </p>

<p>The word “founded” means destining or purposing something. God didn’t just create and then leave his creation (this is the belief of Deism). God is intimately involved, actively at work, in the world he has created. </p>

<p>The idea here the psalmist is putting forth is that God has established not only the earth, not only the heavens, but everything in the world. God is the one who established Pharaoh in Egypt. God is the one who placed Nero as Emperor in Rome. God was the one who placed Donald Trump in the presidency. God was the one who placed Joe Biden. You get the point.</p>

<p>And there is a clear takeaway for us from this: God is always at work, always actively involved, and everything that is happening is happening because God is establishing it, founding it. God has a purpose, and he is working it out.</p>

<h4>God’s sovereignty makes him worthy of worship (v. 12-13)</h4>

<p>“The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.” (Psalm 89:12)</p>

<p>These are two very significant, very important religious locations in the Old Testament that speak to the kind of worship that God’s sovereignty deserves. Mount Tabor was used, generally, in the Old Testament by pagan worship. It was used in idolatrous worship with sacrifices and rituals to all kinds of false gods. It is also the place where Deborah the Judge defeated the army of Sisera. But, Tabor is an incredibly small mountain. In contrast, Mount Hermon was a very sacred place. It was the tallest mountain in ancient Israel. It is the location where Peter confessed Jesus as the Christ and also where the Transfiguration took place.</p> 

<p>Tabor and Hermon are paired as works of God which praise him in different ways: the lowly Tabor (1,900 ft.) by its history, as the scene of Deborah’s victory, and the giant Hermon (9,000 ft.) by its physical majesty. The Creator’s hand is both strong and high in the creation and in the events that transpired at each. And the sight of each, and the history of each mountain, moves the people of Israel to worship God. It points to God’s majesty and his purposes working out in history. It should lead to loud praise.</p> 

<p>If this is true of creation, then how much more should it be true of his redeemed! Streams of mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise!</p>

<p><b>We also see that God is worthy of worship because his sovereignty is proven (v. 13)</b></p>

<p>“You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand.” (Psalm 89:13)</p>

<p>The word used here for strong means being proven, showing oneself. In other words, God has proven his sovereignty. He has shown it to be strong, he has shown it to be powerful, and he has shown it to be reliable. It is proven. </p>

<p>We know this from the testimony of Scripture. God has proven his sovereignty by delivering Israel from Egypt; by setting David up as king on the throne; by sending the promised Messiah to his people; by raising Jesus up from the dead three days after his death; and by sending his Spirit to the church to be with them. God’s sovereignty is proven by Scripture.</p>

<p>We know this from the testimony of history. God’s sovereignty has always protected the gospel. He raised the Church Fathers to fight heresy in the first few centuries. He raised up the Reformers to rescue the gospel and to protect the truth of the Bible. And he is still in the business today of sovereignly raising up and placing people who will fight for truth, fight for the gospel, in the midst of cultural animosity.</p>

<p>And we know this from the testimony of our own lives, don’t we? God has worked throughout all of our lives. God’s sovereignty in our lives is best read backwards, isn’t it? We know looking back all of the ways that God has worked in us, brought people into our lives, placed us into particular locations, all for the purpose of drawing us closer to Him. God's Sovereignty is proven in our own lives.</p>

<p>The divine sovereignty of God is the gentle cushion upon which a believer rests their head each night. There is no characteristic more reassuring to those who are God's children than the supreme authority of their Heavenly Father. Even when traversing the darkest of valleys, it is crucial to depend on this fundamental truth: God's sovereign nature is at work in our most challenging moments, weaving them into a grander tapestry for His honor and our benefit. We must remain steadfast in our belief that nothing exists beyond God's dominion. All aspects of life progress according to the unfathomable intricacies of His will. His ultimate power is always at work, His timing impeccable, and His benevolent hand upon us. As long as He remains seated upon His throne, overseeing every tempest we encounter, we are filled with hope, assured that everything is under His watchful guidance.</p>
