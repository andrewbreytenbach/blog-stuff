# A Firm Foundation in a Founding Father: The Christian Legacy of John Adams

## Introduction

John Adams, the second president of the United States, is an often-overlooked figure in American history. Although his presidency is often overshadowed by that of his more famous successor, Thomas Jefferson, Adams' life and legacy offer valuable lessons for everyone, but partculary for Christians today. In this article, my aim is to examine the life of John Adams and demonstrate what Christians can learn from his example.

## Early Life and Career

John Adams was a prominent figure in the early years of the United States. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts in 1735, he was the eldest of three sons of a farmer and shoemaker. Adams' father valued education and ensured that his sons received a good education. As a result, Adams was able to attend Harvard College, where he studied law.

Adams' legal career began in earnest in 1758 when he was admitted to the bar. He quickly established himself as a successful lawyer, and over the next few years, he became involved in several high-profile legal cases. One of the most famous of these cases was the defense of British soldiers who were charged with murder in the Boston Massacre. Despite the unpopularity of his clients, Adams argued successfully for their acquittal, proving that the soldiers had acted in self-defense.

Adams was not content with a career in law, however. He became increasingly involved in politics, serving as a delegate to the Massachusetts legislature from 1768 to 1774. During this time, he became known for his outspoken opposition to British policies, particularly the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. In 1774, Adams was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in the debate over American independence.

Adams was a staunch supporter of independence, arguing that it was the only way for the American colonies to achieve the freedoms they deserved. In a letter to his wife Abigail, he wrote, "The die is cast. The colonies must either submit or triumph." His determination and perseverance were critical in convincing his fellow delegates to support the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted on July 4, 1776.

Adams' contributions to the fledgling United States did not end with the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, however. He went on to serve as the first vice president of the United States under George Washington and later became the second president of the United States. During his presidency, he was instrumental in securing peace with France, and he also signed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were controversial laws that limited free speech.

Throughout his life, John Adams remained committed to the ideals of liberty and justice. He was a man of strong opinions and was never afraid to speak his mind, even when his views were unpopular. As he wrote in a letter to his son, "Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write." His legacy as a defender of freedom and democracy continues to inspire Americans to this day.

## The American Revolution and Independence

John Adams' contributions to the American Revolution were numerous and critical. As mentioned earlier, he played an essential role in the Continental Congress, where he fought for independence and helped draft the Declaration of Independence. In addition to this, he was also heavily involved in the war effort itself, serving on various committees to provide supplies and troops for the Continental Army.

Adams was also a skilled diplomat, and his efforts in this area played a significant role in the ultimate success of the Revolution. One of his most notable achievements in this regard was his role in negotiating the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war with Britain and recognized the United States as an independent nation.

Adams was one of three American commissioners who were appointed to negotiate the treaty, along with Benjamin Franklin and John Jay. The negotiations were challenging and often contentious, with both sides seeking to secure the best possible terms for themselves. However, Adams was able to remain focused and persistent, working tirelessly to ensure that the interests of the United States were represented.

The Treaty of Paris was ultimately signed on September 3, 1783, and it recognized the United States as a sovereign nation. Adams' role in negotiating the treaty was crucial, and his contributions were recognized by his fellow Americans. As George Washington wrote in a letter to Adams, "The Treaty of Paris has established the reputation of America as a nation capable of contending with, and finally triumphing over all the efforts of her enemies."

Adams' achievements in diplomacy and his contributions to the American Revolution are a testament to his intelligence, determination, and commitment to the cause of liberty. As he once said, "There are two types of education... One should teach us how to make a living, and the other how to live." Adams' education in law and politics allowed him to contribute to the establishment of a new nation and to help lay the foundation for the democracy that Americans enjoy today.

## The Presidency and Later Life

John Adams' presidency was a significant period in American history, marked by both achievements and challenges. As mentioned earlier, he was elected as the second president of the United States in 1796, succeeding George Washington. His presidency was marked by a number of challenges, including conflicts with France and internal political divisions.

One of the most significant challenges of Adams' presidency was the Quasi-War with France. This conflict arose from disputes over trade and diplomatic relations between the United States and France. Adams worked to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but tensions remained high throughout his presidency.

Another controversial issue during Adams' presidency was the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. These laws were intended to protect the United States from foreign influences and limit criticism of the government, but they were widely criticized as an attack on free speech and civil liberties. Adams reluctantly signed the acts into law, but he later expressed regret for doing so, calling them a "blot on his reputation."

Despite these challenges, Adams' presidency also saw several significant achievements. He worked to strengthen the United States' economic and military power, and he signed the Treaty of Tripoli, which affirmed the United States' commitment to peace and friendship with Muslim nations. He also established the United States Marine Band, which remains an important part of American culture today.

Adams' presidency came to an end in 1800 when he was defeated in his bid for reelection by Thomas Jefferson. However, his contributions to American democracy and his commitment to liberty and justice continued to inspire future generations of Americans. As he wrote in a letter to his wife Abigail, "I must study politics and war that my sons may have the liberty to study mathematics and philosophy."

After leaving office, Adams spent his later years in retirement at his farm in Massachusetts. He remained active in politics and continued to correspond with his fellow Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson. In one of their most famous exchanges, Adams and Jefferson reconciled after years of political rivalry, and their correspondence became a symbol of the importance of civility and mutual respect in American politics.

## John Adams: Christian Nationalist?

John Adams' religious views were influenced by his upbringing in a devout Calvinistic Protestant family. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, and Adams himself was raised in this faith. Throughout his life, Adams remained deeply committed to his religious beliefs, which played a significant role in shaping his worldview and his approach to politics.

Adams' Calvinistic Protestant beliefs emphasized the importance of hard work, individual responsibility, and moral purity. He believed that individuals had a responsibility to use their talents and abilities to serve others and to uphold the values of their community. As he wrote in a letter to his son, "Let us not depend too much upon our own wisdom... Let us seek the counsel of others and pray for guidance and direction."

Adams was also a strong advocate for religious freedom and tolerance. He believed that individuals should be free to worship as they chose, without interference from the government or from other religious groups. As he wrote in a letter to his friend Thomas Jefferson, "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."

Despite his commitment to religious freedom, Adams remained deeply rooted in his Calvinistic Protestant beliefs. He believed that individuals had a duty to use their talents and abilities to serve others and to promote the common good. As he wrote in a letter to his wife Abigail, "Public business, my dear, must always be done by somebody. It will be done by somebody or another. If wise men decline it, others will not; if honest men refuse it, others will not."

Throughout his life, John Adams remained committed to his religious beliefs, which played a significant role in shaping his approach to politics and his understanding of the world. As he wrote in a letter to his daughter, "Religion and virtue are the only foundations, not only of republican government, but of social felicity under all governments and in all combinations of human society."

**10 Takeaways for the Christian from the life of John Adams:**

1. Commitment to principles: John Adams demonstrated a steadfast commitment to his principles and values throughout his life, even in the face of opposition and criticism. Christians can learn from his example and seek to live out their faith with courage and conviction, standing firm in their beliefs even when it is difficult to do so.

One scripture that speaks to the importance of living with strong principles is Proverbs 4:25-27, which says, "Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil."

John Adams' commitment to his principles was evident in his opposition to slavery, despite the fact that it was widely accepted in his time. He once said, "I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in abhorrence." Adams' unwavering stance on this issue serves as a powerful example for Christians, who are called to stand up for justice and righteousness, even in the face of opposition.

Living with strong principles also means being willing to stand up for what is right, even when it is unpopular or difficult to do so. As Christians, we are called to follow the example of Jesus, who stood up for what was right, even when it meant facing persecution and death. In John 15:18-19, Jesus says, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you."

Adams' commitment to his principles was not just a matter of personal conviction, but was also motivated by a desire to serve others and make the world a better place. As Christians, we are likewise called to use our gifts and talents to serve others and make a positive impact on the world. In Galatians 5:13-14, the apostle Paul writes, "You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

John Adams' commitment to his principles serves as a powerful example for Christians, reminding us of the importance of standing up for what is right and using our gifts and talents to serve others and make a positive impact on the world. By following in Adams' footsteps and seeking to live our lives with conviction and courage, we can fulfill our calling to be the hands and feet of Jesus in a world that is in desperate need of hope and healing.

2. Humility: Despite his accomplishments, Adams remained humble throughout his life and did not seek personal glory or acclaim. Christians can likewise seek to live humble lives of service, using their gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world.

Humility is a virtue that is greatly valued in many cultures and religions around the world. In Christianity, humility is considered a key characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that humility is the opposite of pride, which is seen as a sin that separates us from God. The book of James says, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble" (James 4:6).

John Adams, the second president of the United States, was known for his humility despite his many accomplishments. He played a key role in the American Revolution and helped draft the Declaration of Independence, yet he never sought personal glory or acclaim. In fact, he once said, "I desire no other inscription over my gravestone than: Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the responsibility of the peace of the world."

Christians can learn from Adams' example and strive to live humble lives of service. Instead of seeking personal gain or recognition, they can use their gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world. The Bible teaches that every person has been given unique gifts and abilities to serve others and bring glory to God. In Romans 12:3-8, Paul writes, "Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully."

As Christians, we are called to follow Jesus' example of humility and service. He came not to be served, but to serve (Matthew 20:28). By putting others' needs before our own and using our gifts and talents to make a positive impact on the world, we can bring glory to God and demonstrate the love of Christ to those around us.

3. Civic engagement: Adams believed that it was the duty of every citizen to participate in the political process and to work to uphold the values of freedom and democracy. Christians can likewise be active participants in their communities, working to promote the common good through their involvement in politics and civic life.

Civic engagement refers to the active participation of individuals in their communities and in the democratic process. John Adams, a founding father of the United States, believed that every citizen had a duty to participate in the political process and to work towards upholding the values of freedom and democracy. He believed that a strong and prosperous nation could only be achieved through the active engagement and involvement of its citizens.

Christians can similarly embrace the call to be active participants in their communities and to promote the common good through their involvement in politics and civic life. The Bible teaches that Christians are called to be salt and light in the world (Matthew 5:13-16). This means that they are to be a positive influence in their communities, working towards justice, equality, and the betterment of society.

Paul, in his letter to the Romans, wrote, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God" (Romans 13:1). This verse teaches that Christians are called to submit to governing authorities and to be good citizens of their respective countries.

Furthermore, in his letter to the Galatians, Paul wrote, "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers" (Galatians 6:10). This verse emphasizes the importance of doing good to all people, regardless of their beliefs or background, and suggests that Christians have a responsibility to be active participants in their communities and to work towards the common good.

Being involved in politics and civic life can take many forms, such as voting, volunteering, and advocating for policies and causes that align with Christian values. It can also mean being informed about local and national issues and engaging in respectful dialogue with others who may hold different viewpoints. By being active participants in their communities and upholding the values of freedom, justice, and democracy, Christians can make a positive impact in the world and reflect the love of Christ to those around them.

In conclusion, John Adams' belief in civic engagement as a duty of every citizen remains relevant today. Christians can similarly embrace this call to participate in the political process and to work towards the common good through their involvement in politics and civic life. Through their actions, they can reflect the love of Christ and make a positive impact in their communities and in the world.

4. Justice and the rule of law: As a lawyer and politician, Adams was known for his honesty and integrity, and he believed strongly in the importance of a just and fair legal system. Christians should likewise be committed to justice and should work to promote fairness and equality in their communities.

Justice and the rule of law are critical components of any democratic society. John Adams was a lawyer and politician who was known for his honesty and integrity, and he strongly believed in the importance of a just and fair legal system. He believed that every person, regardless of their social status or wealth, should have equal access to justice and that laws should be applied equally to all.

As Christians, we are called to pursue justice and promote fairness and equality in our communities. The Bible teaches that justice is an integral part of God's character and that he expects his followers to do justice and love mercy (Micah 6:8). This means that Christians are called to stand up for what is right, even if it means going against the prevailing culture or societal norms.

In the book of Proverbs, it says, "The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern" (Proverbs 29:7). This verse highlights the importance of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized in society and working towards a more just and equitable world. Christians can do this by supporting organizations that promote justice and equality, advocating for policies that uplift the disadvantaged, and using their voices and resources to bring about positive change.

Additionally, Jesus himself was a champion of justice and fairness. In Luke 4:18-19, he read from the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and proclaimed, "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." This passage highlights Jesus' commitment to social justice and his concern for the poor and oppressed.

Would he have lived today, John Adams would also have been dubbed "woke". 

In conclusion, John Adams' belief in the importance of justice and the rule of law remains relevant today. As Christians, we should likewise be committed to promoting fairness and equality in our communities and working towards a more just and equitable world. By following Jesus' example and standing up for what is right, we can reflect the love and justice of God to those around us.

5. Peacemaking and reconciliation: Despite his role in the American Revolution, Adams recognized the importance of negotiating a peaceful settlement with Britain. Christians should likewise be peacemakers, working to build bridges between people and communities and promoting reconciliation and healing in the midst of conflict.

Peacemaking and reconciliation are essential components of a just and peaceful society. John Adams, despite his instrumental role in the American Revolution, recognized the importance of negotiating a peaceful settlement with Britain. He understood that peace and reconciliation were essential for the long-term stability and prosperity of the fledgling nation.

As Christians, we are called to be peacemakers and agents of reconciliation in our communities and in the world. The Bible teaches that peace is a fruit of the Holy Spirit and that we should pursue peace with all people (Galatians 5:22; Hebrews 12:14). This means that Christians should be actively working towards resolving conflicts and building bridges between people and communities.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9). This verse highlights the importance of peacemaking in the Christian life and suggests that those who actively work towards peace and reconciliation are fulfilling God's purpose for their lives.

Additionally, the Bible teaches that reconciliation is a central theme of the Gospel message. Paul wrote, "All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation" (2 Corinthians 5:18-19). This passage emphasizes that God's plan of salvation is based on reconciliation, both between God and humanity and between individuals and communities.

As Christians, we can promote peacemaking and reconciliation in our communities by seeking to understand and empathize with those who hold different beliefs and perspectives, by listening to the concerns and needs of those who are hurting or marginalized, and by actively working towards resolving conflicts and building bridges between people and communities.

In conclusion, John Adams' recognition of the importance of negotiating a peaceful settlement with Britain serves as a reminder that peacemaking and reconciliation are essential for building a just and peaceful society. As Christians, we should be actively working towards peace and reconciliation in our communities and in the world, recognizing that these are central themes of the Gospel message and reflective of God's character and purpose.

6. Freedom and independence: Adams' commitment to freedom and independence should inspire Christians to value the principles of liberty and self-determination, and to be advocates for human rights and dignity for all people.

Freedom and independence are essential components of a just and democratic society. John Adams was a staunch advocate for these principles, and his commitment to freedom and independence played a critical role in the founding of the United States.

As Christians, we should likewise value the principles of liberty and self-determination, recognizing that every person is created in the image of God and possesses inherent dignity and worth. The Bible teaches that human beings are created with the capacity for free will and choice, and that God desires for us to use this freedom to choose righteousness and love (Joshua 24:15; Galatians 5:13).

Furthermore, the Bible teaches that Christ came to set us free from sin and death, and that we are to use our freedom to serve others and live in righteousness (Galatians 5:1; 1 Peter 2:16). This means that as Christians, we should be advocates for human rights and dignity for all people, recognizing that every person has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

In his letter to the Galatians, Paul wrote, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery" (Galatians 5:1). This verse emphasizes that Christ has set us free, and that we are to use our freedom to stand firm in our faith and serve others.

As Christians, we can promote freedom and independence in our communities by advocating for policies and practices that protect human rights and dignity, working to end systems of oppression and exploitation, and supporting organizations that promote justice and equality. We can also be advocates for the freedom and independence of those who are oppressed or marginalized, recognizing that true freedom is not just the absence of external constraints, but also the ability to live fully and flourish as human beings.

In conclusion, John Adams' commitment to freedom and independence should inspire Christians to value the principles of liberty and self-determination, and to be advocates for human rights and dignity for all people. As followers of Christ, we can promote freedom and independence in our communities and in the world, recognizing that every person is created in the image of God and possesses inherent dignity and worth.

7. Education and intellectual curiosity: Adams was a lifelong learner and believed in the importance of education and intellectual curiosity.

Education and intellectual curiosity are essential for personal growth and development, as well as for the betterment of society. John Adams was a lifelong learner and believed in the importance of education and intellectual curiosity. He recognized that knowledge and wisdom were essential for good leadership and for the success of a nation.

As Christians, we should likewise value the pursuit of knowledge and seek to deepen our understanding of the world around us. The Bible teaches that wisdom is a gift from God and that we should seek it with all our hearts (Proverbs 2:6-7). Furthermore, the book of Proverbs emphasizes the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding, and of using wisdom to make good decisions and live a virtuous life.

In his letter to the Colossians, Paul wrote, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God" (Colossians 3:16). This verse highlights the importance of letting the word of Christ dwell in us, and of using our knowledge and understanding to teach and admonish one another in wisdom.

As Christians, we can cultivate our minds and deepen our understanding of the world through a variety of means, such as reading books, attending lectures, engaging in intellectual discussions, and pursuing formal education. By doing so, we can develop the skills and knowledge needed to serve others and make a positive impact on the world.

Furthermore, the book of Proverbs emphasizes the importance of seeking wisdom and guidance from family members and close friends, recognizing that they are sources of support and guidance in our lives.

Paul, in his letter to the Ephesians, wrote, "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her" (Ephesians 5:21-25). This passage highlights the importance of selflessness and mutual submission in marriage, recognizing that a strong and healthy relationship requires sacrifice and love.

As Christians, we can prioritize our relationships by spending quality time with our families, investing in our friendships, and serving our communities with generosity and compassion.
