            <h2>The Marrow of the Gospel</h2>
            <br>
 
 <h4>The Controversy</h4>
 <p>I want you to read very carefully the following statement, and then decided whether you affirm or deny the claim it is making: "I believe that it is not sound and orthodox to teach that we must forsake sin in order to our coming to Christ, and instating us in Covenant with God." If the statement seems confusing and intended to catch you in a theological web of heresy and unintended unorthodoxy, you’re not alone! Let me give you more of the quote, and maybe that will help: "I believe that it is not sound and orthodox to teach that we must forsake sin in order to our coming to Christ, and instating us in Covenant with God. This supposes that a man is in covenant already, and is setting out to keep it; whereas the truth is, he is not in covenant at all, till he be first in Christ; and, by being in Christ, is not only instated in a new relation to God, but also furnished with new abilities to yield obedience to him." Still confusing? Again, you’re not alone!</p>
 <p>This small statement struck a match that lit the fire known as the Marrow Controversy, and we would be wise to revisit this matter today and learn from the issue. For the record, I agree with the statement!</p>
 <p>The controversy began in 1717 when a young minister named Thomas Boston discovered a copy of a book called "The Marrow of Modern Divinity." Boston and several other ministers, known as the "Marrow Men," believed that the book addressed prevailing legalism within the Church of Scotland. They saw legalism as a threat to the doctrine of grace, arguing that it limited the free offer of the Gospel by tying it to the individual's moral performance. They felt the book had a solution to the problem. By emphasizing the free offer of the Gospel and the necessity of personal faith in Jesus Christ, it sought to reconcile the seemingly opposing doctrines of grace and law within Christianity. The Church of Scotland disagreed with these “Marrow Men”, and the book was condemned, the men themselves having their ordinations revoked. </p>
 <p>How did these Marrow Men respond? Well, as only one can when faced with being charged as a heretic, these men developed what has become known as the Auchterarder Creed, a statement of faith that centered on the gospel and the free offer of Christ to sinners. It had ten main principles, listed below, and I highly encourage you to read through each one slowly and think about what these men are saying:
     <ol>
         <li>That all men by nature are dead in trespasses and sins; and so are entirely helpless and without strength to recover themselves, or make the least essay towards it; and, being dead in sin, are subject to eternal wrath and damnation, without the least mitigation or relaxation thereof, except they be quickened and saved by God's free grace.</li>
         <li>That God, before the foundation of the world, hath chosen some of mankind to life, through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will, without foresight of faith, or good works, or any condition performed by the creature.</li>
         <li>That our Lord Jesus Christ hath fully satisfied the justice of God, and made a proper and real atonement for the sins of the whole world, in such a sense, that whosoever shall believe in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life; and that there is no other satisfaction for sin but through His atonement.</li>
         <li>That faith is not a condition of the covenant of grace, but the consequence of it; and that it is not in the power of every man to believe, but is bestowed by God as a free gift of His grace.</li>
         <li>That God, by His almighty power and free grace, worketh in the hearts of His people, to renew their wills, and to enable them, by His grace, to perform spiritual and good works; and that this grace of God is the alone efficient cause of all holy and saving actions.</li>
         <li>That the work of the Holy Spirit, in convincing and converting sinners, is irresistible, and not resistible, if men would.</li>
         <li>That the righteousness of Christ is imputed to believers for their whole and sole righteousness, and that this is the only meritorious cause of their justification before God.</li>
         <li>That those who are effectually called and regenerated, shall persevere in grace to the end, and be eternally saved.</li>
         <li>That God, in His own time, and in His own way, will bring all His elect to a state of glory.</li>
         <li>That Christ is the only Mediator between God and man, and that there is no other name given under heaven whereby we may be saved.</li>
     </ol>
 </p>
 <p>The Church of Scotland rejected this creed, and to this day we still have an unresolved tension there between these Marrow Men and the free offer of the gospel, and the church at large, who argue these men were watering down the gospel. So, who’s right? Contrary to popular belief, in theology there is a right and a wrong, it sometimes just takes more digging to get to the correct answer. </p>
 
 
<h4>The Problem with Legalism</h4>
 <p>The primary charge the Marrow Men leveled against the Church of Scotland was legalism. In other words, they required something of the sinner before the sinner could come to Christ. Legalism errs by making obedience to the law a prerequisite for God's acceptance. It adds conditions to the sinner’s ability to come to Christ. It doesn’t always deny the grace of God, but it distorts or dilutes the grace in such a way that it is no longer grace. What we see from a comprehensive reading of Scripture, though, is that the free offer of the gospel never has conditions attached to it. It’s free. Salvation is tied to grace and faith, not a performance or work we do. Not only were the Marrow Men right in their understanding here, but their view is consistent with the historic Reformed understanding of the relationship between grace, faith, and works.</p>
 <p>How does this legalism play itself out? Repent of your sins first, then come to Christ. End your addiction to alcohol, then you can come to Christ. Break up with your girlfriend in your homosexual relationship, then you can come to Christ. Stop looking at pornography, then come to Christ. The primary error with this is in the order. We offer them Christ, and THEN they deal with their sin. Come to Christ, then repent of your sins. Come to Christ, then end your addiction to alcohol. Unless a sinner is first turned BY God, they cannot turn TO God. This might be unpopular in today’s man-centered view of salvation, but this high Calvinism is so rich in grace in mercy. Think of the way it would change our preaching if we offered the gospel this freely! </p>
 <p>Come to Christ today! Come to Christ and find in him treasures forevermore! Bring with you to Christ all of your sin and shame. Don’t wait to clean yourself up. Jesus knows you can’t do it. He isn’t asking you to. All he asks is for you to come to him!</p>
 <p>This free offer of the gospel understands rightly the doctrine of total depravity and unconditional election. If the “Reformed” Church of Scotland would have examined their understanding of these doctrines, they too would have sided with the Marrow Men and perhaps would have avoided such a silly controversy. Perhaps, too, we might even have seen more salvation and more powerful preaching in the Scottish church. Preaching legalism kills churches and condemns souls. Preaching grace saves souls and gives life to churches. Something to think about this Sunday as you hear the gospel preached at your local church. Is your pastor a Marrow Man? Or does his preaching drip with subtle hints of legalistic criteria to come to Christ?</p>
 <p>There is much more to discuss with the Marrow Controversy, but it is too much for one blog post, so we will be sure to revisit this incredible moment in the history of the Church of Scotland again in the future!</p>
