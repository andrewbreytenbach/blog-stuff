                    <p>Life has gotten very busy for me. You might have noticed that with the less than normal amount of blogs coming your way recently. In a shocking turn of events, this blog doesn’t pay the bills, so I need to get a real job. Don’t worry, this isn’t goodbye. I just need to trim down the number of posts per week. Let’s start off with three per week– Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays. Any complaints, just leave a comment. I still need to add that functionality anyways. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Today, we’re going back into church history. The Edict of Milan, which was issued by Emperor Constantine I and co-emperor Licinius in 313 AD, stands out among historical events that have influenced human communities. Through the implementation of this fundamental decree, the Roman Empire underwent a tremendous transformation from one of religious persecution to one of tolerance, with a focus on Christianity. The Edict of Milan was more than just a change in policy; it represented a crucial period in history when the balance of power within the Roman Empire drastically altered, influencing the development of Western civilization.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Before the Edict, there is plenty of proof that Christians were persecuted in the Roman Empire. For their religious beliefs, Christians were regularly persecuted, mistreated, and in some cases, killed. However, these persecutions varied in scope and location across the broad empire. They fluctuated in intensity according to the preferences of the reigning emperors and the attitudes of the regional governors.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Rome wasn't a centralized authority under a single monarch at the time the edict was issued, which made politics in Rome turbulent. The Roman Empire was divided in 313 AD, with Licinius in charge of the east and Constantine in charge of the west. These co-emperors worked together to create this revolutionary decree because they shared a worry about civic upheaval brought on by religious prejudice.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The ruthless persecution of Christians was not the only goal of the Edict of Milan. By stating that everyone was free to practice the religion of their choice without worrying about negative consequences, it was an important step toward promoting religious tolerance more generally. "We thought it fit to commend these things to your care in the fullest sense so that you may know what is our pleasure: that all the churches are to be surrendered to the Christians," it said.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        A crucial point to remember is that the decree did not establish Christianity as the official religion; that would happen with Emperor Theodosius I's decree of Thessalonica in 380 AD. The Edict of Milan just leveled the playing field, allowing Christianity to flourish and prosper in a tolerant atmosphere. The edict itself was undoubtedly revolutionary, but the considerable social impact it had was mostly attributable to the change in social attitudes it brought about. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Roman Empire successfully legitimized Christianity by enforcing the Edict. As a result, many people found that converting to Christianity was not only a secure choice but also one that would benefit them politically and socially. As a result of this newfound acceptance, the number of Christians throughout the empire increased dramatically. Constantine himself, who converted to Christianity later in life and gave the religion even more credence, helped Christianity grow even farther. This does not mean that it was for the better though. I might be showing my amillennialism now, but I digress. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Edict of Milan did not bring in an age of perfect peace and equality, but it did pave the way for religious tolerance. It had its share of difficulties, as with any large society change. The empire struggled with defining what religious tolerance was and where its bounds should be. Christians were happy, while other Pagans were worried about the possible extinction of old religious beliefs and values.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The edict did, however, establish a precedent for religious freedom within the empire and marked a substantial break from earlier religious laws. It conveyed the strong message that one's religious convictions should not be a reason for persecution, which has served as the cornerstone for the evolution of contemporary ideas of religious liberty and individual rights.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Edict of Milan, which bears witness to the influence of legislative decrees in influencing social norms and behavior, now stands as a monument in the landscape of human history. It serves as a reminder that certain policies have capacity to reconfigure the societal framework, frequently with far-reaching ramifications, in addition to their immediate effects. It is also a potent reminder to Christians of how God’s power is able to convert the most hostile pagan empire to the spread of the gospel.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        The Edict of Milan marked a significant turning point toward religious tolerance. It fundamentally altered the religious climate of the Roman Empire by recognizing the right to freedom of practice. While the edict as a whole was unique to its time and location, the ideas it codified have persisted throughout the ages and have shaped how we currently view religious freedom. The Edict of Milan is more than just a historical occurrence; it is also a living example of how far the gospel has come since the early church almost 2,000 years ago.</p>
