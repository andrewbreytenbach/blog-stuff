                    <h2>Powerful or Pathetic?: The Legacies of Alexander the Great, Hannibal Barca, and Julius Caesar</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>This week’s book review and blog is not on a theological masterpiece written by a titan of the Christian faith. Rather, it focuses on a piece of historical non-fiction (my favorite genre outside of theology) and examines, from a Christian worldview no less, how we ought to think about the “successful” leaders of world history. What traits of theirs should we admire? How should they be studied and understood? Is there any way that Christians can learn from these men?</p>

                    <p>Last week’s read was none other than "Masters of Command: Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, and the Genius of Leadership" by Barry Strauss. If you get the chance, I highly recommend the book for the exciting peak it gives you into the warfare of the past and the minds of these world conquerors. The book explores the leadership qualities of three of history's most renowned military leaders: Alexander the Great, Hannibal Barca, and Julius Caesar. In the opening chapter, Strauss identifies ten key qualities that these leaders exhibited to achieve their incredible feats: ambition, judgment, leadership, audacity, agility, infrastructure, strategy, terror, branding, and divine providence. I couldn’t read a list like that and just move on. So, let’s walk through the list Strauss uses, talk about it, and then see how Christians should interact with these traits. </p>
                    
                    <ol>
                    
                    <li><strong>Ambition:</strong> This is the first trait Strauss says all three of these men had. Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar each had a burning desire to achieve greatness and create lasting legacies. This ambition drove them to pursue bold and daring campaigns, expanding their empires and pushing the limits of their time.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Christians know that we do not go through life chasing ambition or seeking to build our own legacies. Yes, you should have a drive to work hard and excel, but you don’t do this for yourself. You do it for the glory of God. On this first trait of a successful leader, the Bible gives this one a failing grade. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Judgment:</strong> These leaders demonstrated exceptional judgment in assessing complex situations, making decisions that led to victory, and navigating the political landscape. Their ability to make well-informed choices under pressure set them apart from their contemporaries.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    This is a value the Bible would call wisdom and discernment. Yes, this is a value that should be pursued and exemplified, but the book of Proverbs makes it clear this is only found within a healthy view of the fear of the Lord. I would argue that none of these three leaders possessed that, and thus, they lacked true wisdom and discernment. The childish judgment they possessed was nothing that a lucky teenage boy couldn’t have replicated. This one fails too. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar were natural-born leaders, able to inspire and motivate their troops, maintain discipline, and foster loyalty. They led by example, often fighting alongside their soldiers, earning their trust and respect.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    This is an idea that has become all the rage among Christian churches in the last ten years or so. Leadership development and becoming strong leaders seems to be all churches care about. I would argue that any good pastor is by nature a strong leader, but not because of who he is himself, in contrast to these three men. A godly leader is a leader because of who he is following and submitting to: the lordship of Jesus Christ. Thus, while leadership ought to be valued, the type of leadership matters greatly, and once again, these warlords fail epically.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Audacity:</strong> These military commanders were known for their audacious and bold tactics, taking risks that others would shy away from. They embraced unpredictability, catching their enemies off guard and achieving remarkable success.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    This is what most people call recklessness and stupidity. Yes, the victories they won were bold and audacious. But what if they had lost? What if they hadn’t achieved the success they did as a result? History would be reading about their “audacious” acts of childish stupidity. And one more thing: how were the family lives of these great men? Did they marry? Raise kids? It doesn’t seem like we should bother learning the answer to this one since they were so absent from their families the result was likely disastrous. This one is a clear miss for Christians. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Each leader demonstrated remarkable adaptability, adjusting their strategies and tactics in response to changing circumstances. Their ability to think quickly and adapt to new challenges enabled them to outmaneuver their enemies on the battlefield.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    While the circumstances around us change constantly, the gospel message and the Word of God never does. The Christian is not agile in the sense that who we are and what we are about does not and should not change. We preach Christ crucified– that’s it! No other message or no other circumstance should ever tempt us to change that tune.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar understood the importance of a strong infrastructure to support their campaigns. They built roads, bridges, and supply lines to ensure their armies were well-equipped and could operate effectively across vast territories.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    In a great turn of irony, these leaders ended up being pawns used by God to take His gospel to unreached peoples. The rise of roads and infrastructure promoted the increase of travel, and this is how men like Paul and Peter were able to take the gospel in the early church to previously unreached places on their missionary journeys. Places like Galatia and Ephesus would never have been reached had these power-hungry mongrels not taken the time to build roads for their armies to walk on. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> These leaders were master strategists, devising innovative approaches to warfare and employing clever tactics to overcome their opponents. Their strategic prowess was a critical factor in their numerous battlefield victories.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    The Bible doesn’t knock strategy, but it does emphasize that worldly wisdom and power empties the gospel of its power. Paul was very clear about this in the opening chapters of 1 Corinthians. Sure, you can go on and pursue strategy and plan for things. But don’t think that guarantees you anything. The gospel goes forth on its own, irrespective of who you are or what you do. Strategy, if anything, only seems to build false conversions and false empires that are antagonistic to true gospel ministry. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Terror:</strong> Each commander recognized the psychological impact of fear and terror on their enemies, using it to their advantage. They cultivated reputations for ruthlessness, which demoralized their enemies and often led to their capitulation without a fight.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Yeah, I mean this one doesn’t even deserve a response. That’s just sin. It's a characteristic of the devil, not Christ. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Branding:</strong> Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar were skilled at crafting and promoting their own personal brands, reinforcing their image as larger-than-life figures. This helped to solidify their power and inspire loyalty among their followers.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    The Bible repeats over and over against the idea of building a kingdom of self. This was the first sin of Adam and Eve, and it continues to be the root of every sin we ever commit. At its core, sin is choosing ourselves over God. Sin is building your brand, your way, reinforcing that image and making yourself feel better and seem better than you actually are. The world might see this as building your brand. The Bible calls it total depravity. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Divine Providence:</strong> These leaders often attributed their successes to divine intervention, enhancing their mystique and further reinforcing their followers' belief in their invincibility.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Once again, in a great twist of irony, these leaders who thought divine providence was on their side actually were pawns in the greater chess game of God’s redemptive plan. It was due to Alexander the Great’s world conquering that Greek became the common language of the world, resulting in an Old Testament translation in the Greek tongue and also the entire New Testament being written in the common language of the people. It was through the Roman Empire, built on the foundations of Julius Caesar, that the ministry of Jesus took place, including his crucifixion, which was a Roman tool of execution. This one is the definition of Genesis 50:20. What these men meant for evil, God meant for good. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    </li>
                    
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>"Masters of Command" offers valuable insights into the pathetic worldly leadership qualities of Alexander the Great, Hannibal Barca, and Julius Caesar, three military leaders whose impact on history remains unrivaled. By examining these ten qualities, we can learn essential lessons about how Christians should lives if they want to waste them. Their stories demonstrate that ambition, judgment, leadership, and the other key qualities outlined by Strauss are integral to living only for yourself and paving a road straight to hell.</p>
