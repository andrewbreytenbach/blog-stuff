                    Theology Thursday #5- God’s Intrinsic Glory

                    <p>The Bible speaks of God’s glory in two different ways that must be distinguished. The first is God’s intrinsic glory, which will be the focus of this article. The second is his ascribed glory, and to that topic next Thursday’s blog will be devoted.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Understanding the Glory of God</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>The glory of God is the infinite beauty and greatness of his manifold perfections. It is the end of all things and the goal of all things. God’s glory is the manifestation of his holiness. One of the most God-glorifying theologians in church history is Jonathan Edwards, who eloquently described the glory of God like this: <em>[God] has with respect to himself, as his last and highest end, this goal; he is worthy in himself to be infinitely the greatest and best of beings. Everything else, with regard to worthiness, importance, and excellence, are nothing in comparison to him. . . . All that is ever spoken of in the Scripture as an ultimate end of God’s goal is included in that one phrase, the glory of God.</em></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Biblical Story and God's Glory</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>The glory of God is interwoven throughout the biblical story and forms the origin, content, and goal of the entire cosmic narrative. God communicates his glory through his creation, image-bearers, providence, and redemptive acts. In turn, God’s people respond by glorifying him. God receives glory and, through uniting his people to Christ, shares his glory with them.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>God's Chief End: His Own Glory </p></strong>
                    <p>God is the most God-centered person in the universe. Think about that for a minute. Let it sink in. God is the most God-centered person in the universe. That God is self-centered is who He is. When we say that God is God-centered, it means that God is passionate for His own glory. He has a zeal for his own glory. </p>
                    <p>And God loving His glory above all else, even more than He loves us, is actually very good news for us because His glory is the foundation of His love for us. It means he will remain faithful and steadfast; his lovingkindness will stay true.  </p>
                    <p>Sometimes God being God-centered is hard for us to understand because when man is self-centered, there is a problem. When we are self-centered, we are trying to put ourselves at the center of a universe that God should be at the center of. But when God is self-centered it’s not a problem, but is a blessing for us because when God is at the center of a universe that God should be at the center of, things are rightly ordered and in harmony.</p>
                    
                    <p>Think of it like the sun and the stars. When the sun is at the center, everything works just right. But if the earth were to suddenly become the center of the universe, everything would fly into utter chaos and disarray. Just like the sun needs to be the center of the universe, so too does God’s glory need to be the center of God’s focus. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Intrinsic Glory of God</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>God's intrinsic glory represents the whole of His divine being and includes all the perfections of His divine attributes. This intrinsic glory is forever the same, never increasing or decreasing. We cannot give God intrinsic glory, nor can we add to or take away from who He is.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>God's Actions for His Name's Sake</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>In the Bible, we see that God acts for the sake of his name, his reputation, and his glory. This is illustrated in various passages, such as Exodus 32:12, Numbers 14:13–14, and again Isaiah 48:9-11. God's purpose in choosing Israel is to bring about their redemption and salvation through his planned purposes, and the same is true for believers today. Let’s look at the passage in Isaiah and flesh this out a little. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Isaiah 48:9-11</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>“For my name's sake I defer my anger; for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off. Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tried/chosen you in the furnace of affliction.” (Isaiah 48:9-10)</p>
                    <p>One big question that jumps out from this text is: ‘What does God persevere with these sinful people?’</p>
                    <p>First, he acts for his own name’s sake. It is for the sake and reputation of His name that he does what he does. God is not only the holy God visiting judgment (Exod. 12:12) but also the saving and redeeming God (Exod. 6:6–7; 12:13). God is always true to what he has revealed through his word. The word ‘praise’ here means glory. God does what he does for the sake of his glory, for his reputation, for his name. God will not let his reputation, the essence of who he is, be desecrated or trampled because of the sinfulness of the people and their unwillingness to obey him. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, God acts for his praise, the glory due to Him. This is illustrated in Exodus 32:12 and Numbers 14:13–14—if God abandoned Israel, then it would prove to the world that God was not sovereign and good. It would show to the world God was not faithful, he was not good and was unable to keep his covenants. </p>
                    <p>Thirdly, there is God’s purpose in choosing Israel. Why the Lord should so choose is a secret he has kept to himself, but his choice is no passing whim: it is an unalterable commitment of his will. He chose them, knowing that they would choose other gods, turn from him, and pursue their own way. And  he will not be diverted from his choice until he has fulfilled his intention, which is their redemption and salvation through the purposes he has planned long before.</p> 
                    <p>We see also in these verses that the people are refined, but not as silver. Silver endures the fiery furnace until all of the impurities and imperfections are gone. When it is pure, it is removed from the fire. God cannot deal with his people like that. If God left them in the furnace of affliction until they were pure, then there would be no one left! It isn’t affliction that purifies them or makes them clean, it is the grace of God that purifies. Therefore, though he brings his people through trials, there is always a limit set: they are never treated as they deserve, always for the fulfillment of his purpose. God chooses to bring them through these trials so that his glory might be put on the greatest display possible. </p>
                    <p>“For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.” (Isaiah 48:11)</p>
                    <p>The Hebrew word for glory here is kabod. It means a weight, a burden, a heaviness– something with reputation, great importance, and honor or splendor. The glory of God in these verses deals pointedly with God’s reputation, his standing or fame in the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>God will not give his glory to another. He will not hand it down, lay it aside, surrender it, or turn it into a lesser being. There is way more at stake here than just the well being of the people of Israel. The honor of the Lord’s name is at stake. The world must know that it is he, and not Babylon, Baal, Caesar, or the White House, who rules the world, and for that reason he will press on, regardless of how his people respond. If Israel’s sinfulness were able to defeat the Lord’s purposes, then sin would get glory over God; if His people remain in exile, then the gods of Israel’s enemies triumph. But neither the forces of history nor the power of sin will win the day. God will not let his glory be defiled or desecrated by the evil forces in the world. He gloriously triumphs over them.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>God's Glory and Human Salvation</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>God performs salvation for His own sake. The cross was the apex of God’s glory put on display and the climax of His grace being lavished on us. God justifies the people called by His name in order that He may be glorified. God's ultimate commitment is to Himself and not to us, and therein lies our security. God loves His glory above all. Therefore, we have assurance. God will not let us go. What He started, He will finish.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</p></strong>
                    
                    <p>Romans 11:36 encapsulates the glory of God in a simple, clear, and comprehensive sentence: "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen." This verse demonstrates the importance of understanding and revering the glory of God in all aspects of creation, history, and salvation. May we go about this day with the glory of God at the forefront of our minds, such that our chief end might be to glorify God above all else and to enjoy his glory forever.</p>
