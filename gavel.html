            <h2>What Defines You?</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p>What defines you? Ask the question to any modern secularist, agnostic, or follower of a major religion, and you are bound to get as many different answers as people you posit the question True. Deep down, this reveals the lack of clarity and the certainty of confusion surrounding this topic of identity. I don’t have time or the space to discuss the identity crisis culture is facing today. I think it is safe to assume there is an identity crisis, that this identity crisis is the source of much of the pain and conflict in the world today, and that this identity crisis ultimately stems from a lack of knowledge regarding the plain teachings of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Here’s what I mean. Sure, if you ask an agnostic, a Jew, and a Musim what defines them, you would hopefully get three different answers (if you didn’t, you might be forced to wonder why they each adhere to a different worldview that shapes their entire lives). But, if you were to ask an Anglican, a Baptist, and a Presbyterian what defines them, what answer or answers would you get? If our lives are truly in submission to the Word of God, it would logically follow that we would hopefully get similar answers from all three. </p>
            <p>As I endeavor to unpack this massive question of identity and what defines you, let me give you my proposed answer up front. I propose that for the orthodox, evangelical Christian, the best and most biblical answer to what defines you on this side of eternity is a forgiven sinner who has been declared righteous by the blood of Christ. Yes, there are other biblical answers to the question, but I believe this is the best possible answer. Let me explain why, and to do this I’ll break down the sentence part by part. </p>
            
            <h4>"A forgiven sinner":</h4>
            <p>This is to emphasize that all humans are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). This is the doctrine known as total depravity. As a result, everyone needs forgiveness from God for their sins. Everyone must recognize themself as a sinner in need of forgiveness, as this acknowledgment is crucial for experiencing God's grace.</p>
            
             
            <h4>"who has been declared":</h4>
            <p>This passive construction highlights that the action of being declared righteous is not something the individual achieves on their own merit. Instead, it is a declaration made by God. It emphasizes that justification, or being declared righteous, is a gift from God, rather than an accomplishment.</p>
            
             
            <h4>"righteous":</h4>
            <p>The righteousness is provided by God. What God demands and God requires, God provides in the gospel. Sinners need more than forgiveness. There has to be a positive righteousness in order to be accepted before God. Justification is the reception of righteousness. Forgiveness is simply the removal of sin. In theological terms, "righteous" refers to being in a right relationship with God, with sins forgiven and no longer held against the individual. This righteousness is not inherent to human beings but is imputed to them through faith in Jesus Christ. This righteousness is not an earned status but a gift from God, granted to those who trust in Christ for salvation.</p>
            
             
            <h4>"by the blood of Christ":</h4>
            <p>This phrase refers to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on the cross, where He shed His blood for the atonement of human sins. Christ's death is the only means by which human beings can be reconciled to God and attain forgiveness for their sins. This idea comes from passages such as Hebrews 9:22, which states that "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."</p>
            
             
            <h4>Putting it all together:</h4>
            <p>The sentence "a forgiven sinner who has been declared righteous by the blood of Christ" would be understood as a concise summary of the core beliefs of the Christian faith. It emphasizes the human condition as inherently sinful and in need of forgiveness, the gracious act of God in declaring believers righteous, and the centrality of Christ's sacrificial death as the means of atonement and reconciliation between God and humanity. This underscores the importance of understanding oneself as a forgiven sinner, wholly reliant on the grace of God and the work of Christ for salvation. This perspective fosters humility, gratitude, and a deep appreciation for the love and mercy of God displayed through Jesus' atoning sacrifice.</p>
