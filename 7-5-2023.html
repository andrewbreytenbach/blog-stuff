                    <br>
                    <p>It is fitting for this Independence Day blog post that I write on one of the most treasured ideas in American society, an idea which is at the heart of what it means to be American. Today, I want to write about capitalism and the beauty of such an economic system and even more importantly, that way of thinking. I want to do this by discussing a book I just finished called ‘Atlas Shrugged’ by Ayn Rand. She was born in Russia but moved to America in the 1920s. Thus, it isn’t hard to see or imagine how she came to become such a big proponent of capitalism. Anyone who has ever lived under any other economic system will, once tasting the goodness of capitalism, dare never go back to the other inferior systems of the world. It is in this upbringing that Rand conceives the masterpiece ‘Atlas Shrugged’, a timeless commentary showing the foolish futility of socialism. Ironically, this book is even more relevant today than when Rand wrote it, since the progressive agendas of many young Americans hail socialist ideology as the goal of a perfect economy. Rand goes beneath the surface, showcasing the true evils of socialism in a novel that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat as you turn the next page. In order for us to engage with the main thrust of the book, I need to give you a fairly comprehensive summary. Bear with me, it won’t be as long as it could have been.

                        <strong>Book Summary</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        As the economy continues to deteriorate, Dagny Taggart, vice president in charge of operations, attempts to fix Taggart Transcontinental's dilapidated Rio Norte Line so that it can serve Colorado, the last thriving industrial region in the nation. The fact that many of the nation's most talented entrepreneurs are retiring and disappearing hinders her efforts. When the Mexican government nationalizes Taggart's San Sebastian Line, the railroad's predicament gets worse. The line was erected to supply copper mills owned by Francisco d'Anconia, but the mills ended up being worthless. Francisco used to be a wealthy businessman and Dagny's sweetheart, but now he's just a plaything. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Jim, Dagny's brother, utilizes his political connections to get legislation that eliminates Taggart's sole rival in Colorado in order to fix the railroad's financial issues. Dagny intends to use Hank Rearden's new alloy Rearden Metal to fix the Rio Norte Line as soon as possible. When questioned about the San Sebastian mines, Francisco claims to be purposefully destroying d'Anconia Copper, according to Dagny. Later, he shows up for Rearden's anniversary celebration and, upon meeting him for the first time, exhorts Rearden to reject the parasitic freeloaders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Rearden metal is condemned by the State Science Institute, and Taggart's stock drops as a result. In order to reestablish the line, Dagny decides to launch her own business, which is a big success. Rearden and Dagny fall in love. They locate a motor that operates on static electricity in an abandoned factory together, and they go in search of the creator. New regulations are enacted by the government that harm Colorado's business climate. After lighting his wells on fire, oil industrialist Ellis Wyatt abruptly vanishes. As a result of Dagny's forced train cuts, the situation gets worse. More industrialists will soon vanish. Dagny thinks a destructor is at work, stealing guys away just when they're needed. Francisco asks Rearden why he runs his company in such oppressive circumstances when he visits him. When a fire breaks out and they work together to put it out, Francisco understands Rearden’s love for his mills.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Rearden is put on trial for violating one of the new laws, but he declines to take part in the trial, telling the judges they can use force to intimidate him, but he won't assist them find him guilty. To avoid being perceived as thugs, they released him. Wesley Mouch, the economic dictator, needs Rearden's support to enact a new set of socialist laws, while Jim needs financial assistance to maintain the operation of his failing railroad after Colorado's collapse. Lillian, Rearden's wife, who wishes to be rid of her husband, responds to Jim's appeal. He makes a bargain using her information that Rearden and Dagny are having an affair. The new legislation, known as Directive 10-289, is oppressive and unreasonable. It also stipulates that the government must be given ownership of all patents. Rearden is coerced into signing away his metal in order to preserve Dagny's good name.

                        Due to the new directive, Dagny resigns and goes to a lodge in the mountains. She returns to work after hearing about a significant accident at the Taggart Tunnel. The scientist she had hired to assist in rebuilding the motor writes her a letter, and she worries that he may be the destroyer's next prey. She flies after him in an attempt to stop him from vanishing, but the plane crashes in the mountains. She finds herself in a rural valley full with retired industrialists when she awakens. They are on strike and refer to it as a mental strike. She encounters John Galt there, who turns out to be the motor's creator as well as the destruction. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Despite falling in love with him, she departs the valley because she is unable to give up her railroad. When she goes back to work, she discovers that the railroad industry has been nationalized. Her address should reassure the public about the new rules, according to government officials. She resists until Lillian shows up and demands money. She openly confesses her relationship with Rearden on live and says that he has been the victim of blackmail. She issues a warning to the populace about the oppressive regime.

                        Francisco destroys the last of his assets and vanishes when the economy is on the point of collapsing. Politicians no longer even make the pretense of serving the public interest. Crops wilt while waiting for freight trains that are diverted for personal favors, which adds to the turmoil created by their extensive network of influence peddling. The government incites a disturbance at Rearden Steel in an effort to seize control of Francisco's mills. Francisco, who has been operating clandestinely at the mills, is the leader of the steelworkers' organization and resistance movement. Rearden is saved by Francisco, who later persuades him to join the strike.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        John Galt takes over the airwaves and gives a lengthy speech to the nation outlining the parameters of the strike he has organized just as the head of state is getting ready to speak on the state of the economy. Galt is sought after by the government to become their economic dictator out of desperation. By accident pointing them in his direction, Dagny enables them to capture him. Galt, however, refuses to assist them while being tortured. Finally, in a struggle with armed guards, Dagny and the strikers manage to save him. Dagny finally joins the strike when they get back to the valley. The nation will soon be completely destroyed, and the strikers are getting ready to go home.

                        So, with that lengthy discourse on the novel (you really should still read it), let me give you a few of the major takeaways for us today. I promise, this section will be much briefer than the book summary. 
                        <br>

                        <strong>The Importance of the Mind</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        This major concept of the book is shown by the "strike of the mind" led by John Galt. When the world's most creative brains are routinely exterminated, their significance is made clear. Without great thinkers, civilization descends rapidly. As a result of the economy's collapse, insane looters take control. Contrary to conventional thinking, which holds that labor is the primary cause of success, Rand believes that the mind is fundamentally important. The novel's events demonstrate how the mind fuels the world's engine and allows for creation and innovation. Without the direction of the mind, labor cannot produce productivity and riches by itself.

                        <strong>The Evils of Collectivism</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Rand's goal in writing the book was to illustrate what occurs when socialist ideologies are adopted by governments. She contends that men become chaotic and bad when they are forced by collectivism's imposed moral code to prioritize the interests of their neighbors over their own logical self-interest. When incentives are gone, corruption is unavoidable. The history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company serves as an excellent example of this. After the plant implemented a system in which workers were paid according to their perceived needs and assigned tasks based on their perceived abilities, the employees grew depraved and immoral, each one trying to portray themselves as the least talented and most in need. Due to distrust and greed, the factory failed, and the neighborhood was destroyed. For Rand, any economic or political plan based on sacrifice of the individual for the group leads to chaos and destruction.

                        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        The biggest eye-opener for me after reading this book was understanding that capitalism or socialism are not just economic systems. They certainly are not less than that, but they are so much more. In a socialist economy, where need is the driving force, individuals have no incentive. Need becomes the main prerogative for anything. Thus, when someone wants to go to school somewhere, wants to take a certain job, wants to move somewhere, etc. The limiting factor is on whether or not the government determines their desire to be a want or a need. If it is a want, it will be left unmet. If it is deemed a need (who really knows how they determine this sort of thing), then it will be given to them, but not how they wanted it. It will be cheaper, run down, corrupt, and easily broken. That’s how things work in socialist countries.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        In a capitalist economy, where want is the driving force, you are the limiting factor. You determine where you live, how you work, what you eat, etc. That is the beauty of the entire system. The ideas and implications of capitalism reach out far beyond just economics and grasp other areas of life. For example, freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and so many other rights we cherish as Americans would not be permitted in a socialist country. The government controls those things, because they control the needs. But not in America. And that’s why I love this land. Mr. Greenwood said it best: “God bless the USA!”.</p>
