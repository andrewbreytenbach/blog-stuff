            <h2>The Write Stuff: Introductory Matters for an Important Journey</h2>
            <br>
            <h6>Welcome to the blog!</h6>
		<p>In the world of computer programming, this would be my proverbial “Hello, World”. Or, for a more common example, my planting a flag on new and uncharted territory, like the moon landing they faked. Just kidding (sort of). Even though I don’t know you and you don’t know me, it feels like we should make this as normal as possible, and the best way to do that is through an introductory post. In this brief introductory post, I want to explain why I started it and what you can expect in terms of content.</p>
		<p>First, why I started it. As Benjamin Franklin once said, "Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing." These words have stuck with me and inspired me to start my own blog. While I do believe that everyone has something to say, I don’t think everyone should say it, so my aim is to make this blog something worth saying.</p>
		<p>As C.S. Lewis said, "You can make anything by writing." It is a form of creation, and creation is just one simple way I can exercise my imago dei, my being made in the image of God. Writing has always been a way for me to process my thoughts and emotions, and I wanted to create a space where I could do that openly and honestly, especially in a day and age where people get canceled for doing completely normal and rational things.</p>
		<p>I want to write about topics that matter and are relevant,as well as share my perspectives, experiences, and what I am learning. Starting a blog is not always easy, and there have been times when I have doubted myself and wondered if anyone is reading what I write. But I believe in the power of writing, and I believe that if I keep writing, something meaningful will come of it. Okay, I don’t actually think that last sentence was entirely true. There’s a really good chance this blog never amounts to anything. But that’s okay. At least I’ll have had some fun along the way, and offended one or two people while I did it.</p>
		<p>So, without further ado, here are the rules of the blog, subject to be added to per my discretion:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All of Christ for all of life, so anything is fair game. Yes, anything, women’s basketball to Fox news to limited atonement, heck, even a good ribeye isn’t even off limits to write about. If that makes me Christian nationalist or an over-realized Calvinistic Protestant, then so be it. I grew up Dutch Reformed, so that means I can trace my lineage back to Abraham Kuyper, and his theology was pretty solid.</li>
			<li>A relentless commitment to Scripture as the guide and ultimate source of truth. I have lots of opinions about lots of things. But where my opinions contradict with Scripture, Scripture takes the cake and wins every single time.</li>
			<li>I want to write as often as possible, but life happens and I have other things that I need to do. I wish life were as simple as going to a coffee shop, reading and writing all day, and then washing, rinsing, and repeating the whole cycle over again the next day, but it’s not. So, stay tuned for weekly-ish blogs, or as often as the pen hits the paper.</li>
			<li>I don’t plan on filtering my thoughts on this blog. I hate cancel culture, and so I won’t censor or cancel my thoughts or words. Kind of why I made the whole thing anonymous… As Franz Kafka once said, “Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly."</li>
            <li>Because I don’t plan on filtering, you’re going to see pretty quickly the lens through which I see things. My lens isn’t based on culture. It’s based on the Bible, and 2,000 years of church history following the written Scriptures. So, let me rip the first band-aid off for you and just let one cat out of the bag. I’m a Calvinist. I’ll throw the label on myself so you don’t have to. And I’m not going to apologize for it. There’s worse things in life than being thrown in a camp with the godliest men in the history of Christianity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One last piece of authorial commentary: why the name ‘unworthy servant’?</p>
        <p>In the gospel of Luke chapter 17, starting in verse 7, we find these words written:</p>
        <p>“Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and recline at table’?  Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink’?  Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?  So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’”</p>
        <p>That’s pretty self explanatory, but let me add just a few thoughts. Every follower of Jesus is an unworthy servant. It is our duty and our delight to make much of Christ and to bring glory to God in whatever we do. For me, I have a desire to write and I delight in the ways the Lord has gifted me unto this end. Thus, when it came to choosing a name for the blog, unworthy servant seemed appropriate. That’s all I am, and anything I do or create on this platform is not worthy of praise or adoration. I am simply doing what I was created to do, and in doing so glorifying God. </p>
